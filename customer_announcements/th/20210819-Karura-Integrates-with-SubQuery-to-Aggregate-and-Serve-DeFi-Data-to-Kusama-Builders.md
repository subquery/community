# Karura Integrates with SubQuery to Aggregate and Serve DeFi Data to Kusama Builders

In recent weeks, Karura and Acala team celebrated the launch of [Karura Swap](https://apps.karura.network/), the first decentralized exchange in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.

Today, we explore how SubQuery helped make this launch possible. Karura is using SubQuery to extract and query data from Karura's chain, making queries fast and efficient for [Karura's app](https://apps.karura.network/).

> "Using Subquery makes building dapps easy, no more making a complicated series of calls to get the data I need."* --- Brett (Developer at Acala)*

Developing dApps on Karura is now much faster with the new public SubQuery projects published by Karura. There is a publicly available [SubQuery project](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura) that the Karura community can fork and build any dApp that they desire. Additionally, a [Karura Dictionary](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura-dictionary) makes [indexing much faster](https://subquery.medium.com/subquerys-just-got-a-lot-faster-with-the-dictionary-8a7a1447574).

## What is Karura?

Founded by the Acala Foundation, Karura is a scalable, EVM-compatible network optimized for DeFi, and built on Kusama. It's an all-in-one DeFi platform that offers a suite of financial applications including: a trustless staking derivative (liquid KSM), a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets (kUSD), and an AMM DEX (Karura Swap) --- all with micro gas fees that can be paid in any token. Go [here](http://apps.karura.network) to try the live app that uses SubQuery.

Karura also provides an ethical and sustainable token distribution model as well as an on-chain Karura Treasury, both of which support its community and longevity. Karura was the first parachain to win a parachain slot auction on Kusama, gathering a crowdloan upwards of 500,000 KSM ($100M USD) from its community. Because Karura leverages the novel Acala EVM, which enables Ethereum compatibility with unlimited Substrate* functionality, the network is primed to support the deployment of leading DeFi projects who aim to expand their services beyond Ethereum.

## Open Tools for Karura DApp Builders

It's now up to the Karura community to build the first community dApp in the DeFi hub of Kusama. Below is a simple example of how Karura can use SubQuery to find and retrieve the past extrinsics (and the transfers within them) for any account on Karura --- you can see that this is made completely online in the [SubQuery explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura).

## เกี่ยวกับ SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data aggregation layer that will operate between the layer-1 blockchains (Karura) and dApps. SubQuery allows dApp developers to explore and transform on-chain data to build intuitive dApps faster, without needing to worry about building or managing custom backends for data processing.
