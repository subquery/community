**_We are excited to highlight a new SubQuery project that is a great example of the power of SubQuery_**

เมื่อสัปดาห์ที่แล้ว [Subvis.io](https://www.subvis.io/) ได้เปิดตัว explorer ใหม่สำหรับการประมูลสล็อต Kusama parachain This new website provides contextual up-to-date information about the crowdloans and auctions that have just begun on Kusama.

The Subvis.io Auction Dashboard

By exposing this network data on SubQuery, [Subvis.io](https://www.subvis.io/) is demonstrating to all that rich insights can already be extracted from on-chain data.

> _“SubQuery made it easy to collect complicated chain data for Subvis and to sum it up for display in our website. We didn’t have to create any databases or deploy anything to AWS— SubQuery’s scaffolded solution just worked!”. — Subvis.io_

[SubQuery’s](https://subquery.network/) service helps [Subvis.io](https://www.subvis.io/) transform and aggregate Kusama data and to make it more accessible for normal users to understand and read.

[Thanks to SubQuery, we can easily query](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/subvis-io/kusama-auction) the total contributions to each parachain, and see how this data changes over time. For example, we can get the 5 largest single contributions to crowdloans through the query below

Of the ~37,000 contributions made to all crowdloans, the largest single contribution was to Karura with 18.25k KSM

You could also get the the most up to date bids for each auction using the query below

The most recent 3 bids were all by Karura over slots 13–20

Subvis.io is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services for this service is completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).

[สำรวจชุดข้อมูล Subvis.io](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/subvis-io/kusama-auction)

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data aggregation layer that will operate between the layer-1 blockchains (Kusama) and DApps (like Subvis.io). This service allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.
