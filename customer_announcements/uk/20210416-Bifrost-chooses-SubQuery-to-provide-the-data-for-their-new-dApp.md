Bifrost recently launched the beta of their new dApp, the official interactive interface for all Bifrost services. Through this dApp, users can mint vTokens, redeem and swap these derivatives, and view their earnings in real time. This beta dApp is a huge step forward in allowing users to reduce staking costs across chains by maintaining liquidity. [You can try out Bifrost’s new dApp here](https://apps.bifrost.finance/).

> “Without SubQuery, it is difficult to imagine how complicated it is to manually collect data from the chain. Bifrost developers may spend a lot of time searching for all transaction data on chain to be used for transaction history. SubQuery helps developers save a lot of repetitive work costs. Bifrost will cooperate with SubQuery for a long time to accelerate the iterative speed of product development”. — Bifrost.Finance

The new Bifrost SubQuery project in the SubQuery Explorer

[SubQuery’s](https://subquery.network/) service helps [Bifrost](https://bifrost.finance/) power much of the data shown in their new dApp. All historical data on transfers, minting, and redemption events (such as price, date, currency and pool) are aggregated and queried from SubQuery’s advanced indexing and query service. For example, SubQuery allows Bifrost to calculate real time mint and redemption prices for vDot and vEth to show in their app, and to get the total number of vTokens in a certain wallet.

A simple example showing real time mint price for vDOT

Bifrost is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services for this service is completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/). You can play around with the Bifrost SubQuery dataset using the Explorer without implementing any code [here](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/bifrost-finance/subql).

Another SubQuery example to retrieve total staking revenue for vDOT

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data aggregation layer that will operate between the layer-1 blockchains (Bifrost) and DApps. The solution aggregates and organises data from [Bifrost](https://bifrost.finance/) and other blockchains, serving up well-structured data for their dApp and for other developers to use in a wide array of projects. This service allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.
