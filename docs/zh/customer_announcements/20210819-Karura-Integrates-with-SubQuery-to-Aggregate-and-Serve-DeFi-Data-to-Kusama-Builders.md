最近几个星期，Karura和Acala小组庆祝 [Karura Swap](https://apps.karura.network/)发射，这是Polkadot/Kusama生态系统中第一个分散化的交易所。

Today, we explore how SubQuery helped make this launch possible. Today, we explore how SubQuery helped make this launch possible. Karura is using SubQuery to extract and query data from Karura's chain, making queries fast and efficient for [Karura's app](https://apps.karura.network/).

> "Using Subquery makes building dapps easy, no more making a complicated series of calls to get the data I need."* --- Brett (Developer at Acala)*

Developing dApps on Karura is now much faster with the new public SubQuery projects published by Karura. Developing dApps on Karura is now much faster with the new public SubQuery projects published by Karura. There is a publicly available [SubQuery project](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura) that the Karura community can fork and build any dApp that they desire. Additionally, a [Karura Dictionary](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura-dictionary) makes [indexing much faster](https://subquery.medium.com/subquerys-just-got-a-lot-faster-with-the-dictionary-8a7a1447574).

## What is Karura?

Founded by the Acala Foundation, Karura is a scalable, EVM-compatible network optimized for DeFi, and built on Kusama. It's an all-in-one DeFi platform that offers a suite of financial applications including: a trustless staking derivative (liquid KSM), a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets (kUSD), and an AMM DEX (Karura Swap) --- all with micro gas fees that can be paid in any token.

Karura also provides an ethical and sustainable token distribution model as well as an on-chain Karura Treasury, both of which support its community and longevity. Karura was the first parachain to win a parachain slot auction on Kusama, gathering a crowdloan upwards of 500,000 KSM ($100M USD) from its community. Because Karura leverages the novel Acala EVM, which enables Ethereum compatibility with unlimited Substrate* functionality, the network is primed to support the deployment of leading DeFi projects who aim to expand their services beyond Ethereum.

*[Substrate](http://substrate.dev/) *is the blockchain-building framework for building on Polkadot and Kusama*

## Open Tools for Karura DApp Builders

It's now up to the Karura community to build the first community dApp in the DeFi hub of Kusama. It's now up to the Karura community to build the first community dApp in the DeFi hub of Kusama. Below is a simple example of how Karura can use SubQuery to find and retrieve the past extrinsics (and the transfers within them) for any account on Karura --- you can see that this is made completely online in the [SubQuery explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura).

## 关于 SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data aggregation layer that will operate between the layer-1 blockchains (Karura) and dApps. SubQuery allows dApp developers to explore and transform on-chain data to build intuitive dApps faster, without needing to worry about building or managing custom backends for data processing.
