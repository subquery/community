上个星期， [DotMarketCap.com](https://dotmarketcap.com/) 在第二批 Kusama 平行链拍卖之前就开启了提供数据、Polkadot/Kusama 生态系统上的博客、价格和其他内容的功能。

大量实时实时实时数据来自 SubQuery，特别是来自由 [SubVis](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/subvis-io/kusama-auction) 维护的项目。 这是一个很好的例子，说明了 [SubQuery 的 Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) 和开源方法是如何促进 Polkadot 生态系统中的协作和团队合作的。

> *"SubQuery, 每天有超过60个项目和数百万查询请求以及来自 Subvis 的数据， 是支持和提供 DotMarketCap 最快和最准确地访问众贷数据的完美地方。 With that reliable data source and DMC's signature UI UX, we believe this partnership will bring great experience and easy access to the Polkadot community."* - Sang Tran (Founder DotMarketCap)

Kusama parachain auction is the most important event this year, and with [Auction & Crowdloan tracking](https://dotmarketcap.com/auction), you can stay up to date of the fierce competition between projects, as well as support your favourite candidates to win a parachain slot via their crowdloan.

For SubQuery, this is a realisation of our goal to build an open community marketplace of data in our Explorer. This is the best example so far of a huge customer consuming data from a SubQuery project built and maintained by another team. It shows how symbiotic the Polkadot ecosystem is, and how teams work together to achieved a shared goal of a decentralised future This is the best example so far of a huge customer consuming data from a SubQuery project built and maintained by another team.

> *"For sure DotMarketCap 2.0 couldn’t be completed without the support of our partners: SubQuery and [Subvis.io](http://subvis.io/). All the data we used for our auction & crowdloan page was taken from [Subvis.io](http://subvis.io/). Thanks to this cooperation, things are much easier for us to get access to decentralised data. We would like to express our gratitude to Sam Zou, James Bayly and the entire SubQuery team."* - DotMarketCap
