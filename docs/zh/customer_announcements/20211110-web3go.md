SubQuery很高兴地宣布与Polkadot全新数据分析平台[Web3Go](https://www.web3go.xyz/)的合作伙伴关系。 与SubQuery类似，Web3Go被设计成一个易于使用的项目，解锁有关于Polkadot及其平行链的数据。

由[Litentry](https://www.litentry.com/)团队打造的Web3Go在近日举办的万向/Web3基金会黑客马拉松上获得三项大奖，其中包括总排名二等奖、Web3基金会特等奖和[Moonbeam Network](https://moonbeam.network/)最具发展潜力奖。

自Web3Go成立至今，其一直在提供各种平行链众贷和股权数据的可视化，包括从像Karura这样的DeFi工具中提取数据，而这些底层数据都是由SubQuery提供的。 您可以在 [https://web3go.xyz](https://web3go.xyz/#/) 查看此内容

在Web3Go顺滑的产品体验下，它的底层运行了一个定制化的 SubQuery 版本来为交互式自定义查询模块提供助力。 SubQuery 收集并组织实时在链上的数据，使其成为Web3Go接口的数据库，进而为分析人员提供查询、提取、管理数据和生成数据板等功能。

> * " Web3Go与SubQuery的目标一致，即让所有人都可以访问Polkadot数据。 我们很自豪能与Web3Go团队合作，他们在我们的数据上构建了一个漂亮的用户界面，以解锁区块链数据中的丰富故事，让分析师、消费者和投资者更容易访问它们。* — Sam Zou

> * " SubQuery让构建数据查询工具的体验变得无比顺滑。 It makes collecting data simple and was a key reason why we were able to develop a myriad of data dashboards swimmingly and efficiently. To top it off, there’s minimal work to simultaneously generate insights across different parachains like Karura and Moonriver.”* — Hao Ding, Founder — Web3Go

[SubQuery’s](https://subquery.network/) service helps Web3Go build the dashboard of Polkadot parachains auction on the first day when this big event started. This dashboard not only contains the real-time crowdloan quantity and progress of each project but also contains the details of each contribution from individual participants and third parties(Parallel, Bifrost, and Exchange).

The address which gets involved in the crowdloan has been tracked and analyzed, and the data on the chain can be synchronized in real-time for further data mining. The richness of this dashboard even exceeds that of the crowdloan data display page on other websites like Polkadot.js. This dashboard is used and followed by a large number of community users, and there were over 10,000 page views on the first day. It is an excellent example of the combination of data application analysis (Web3Go) and underlying indexing tools (SubQuery) to power [Polkadot parachain real-time tracking.](https://web3go.xyz/#/ParaChainProfiler4Polkadot?chainType=Polkadot)

In the example below, using SubQuery’s data indexing infrastructure, Web3Go is able to process, query data in the Data Query Module, and provide custom data display on a specific event. For instance, this is widely seen in the Kusama Crowdloan dashboard, where the daily increase amount of KSM raised can be queried, extracted and the result be presented in corresponding visualizations. By using Web3Go’s interface and writing SQL, users can generate charts automatically and publish them to the community for reference or application. The notion behind this is the equal access to data and common value sharing, where all users can truly grasp the untapped value behind blockchain data with minimum effort.

Web3Go is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services we provide are completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).

## About Web3Go

[Web3Go](https://www.web3go.xyz/) is an open data analytics platform that allows users to extract, curate and visualize data with powerful yet easy-to-use tools.

Deeply rooted in the Polkadot ecosystem, Web3Go provides a series of Web 3 data related services: Micro-level analysis and visualization of cross-chain assets transactions, parachain slot auctions, DeFi activities and token transaction histories; Sophisticated address labeling system to create user portraits and accumulate user identity library according to the behavior data on the chain; Utilizing Substrate Smart Contract, a reward system is deployed to incentivize users to post data task and patronize data professions on Web3Go. Altogether, Web3Go will provide the essential technical infrastructure for data applications of all kinds in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications (DApps like Web3Go). Currently focused on Polkadot and Substrate projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.
