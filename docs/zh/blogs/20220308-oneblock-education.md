# SubQuery扩大与OneBlock+的合作伙伴关系，在中国推广区块链教育

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*vr-DzLokDkkiY4ss)

今天，我们高兴地宣布，我们将继续与OneBlock+合作，从4月初开始在中国举办第二轮 ["英雄课程"](https://doc.subquery.network/academy/herocourse/)。

SubQuery使世界上的去中心化数据更容易获取的任务取决于是否有一个熟悉解决办法的开发者网络。 OneBlock+ 是中国区块链教育中公认的领先者，帮助我们运行我们现有课程的定制版本，其名称为“为初学者提供的SubQuery - 以简单的方式学习区块链数据索引”。

从1月10日至2月28日毕业典礼期间，有90名学生参加了这个课程。 第一批学生通过WeChat学习，作为他们常规的 Substrate 周六课程的一部分在现场技术讲习班。 OneBlock+还通过腾讯会议平台上的每周“办公时间”向学生提供额外的学习支助。

> _"感谢OneBlock+ 和 SubQuery 创建了这么好的课程。 课程很好，我能够通过完成课程来掌握SubQuery的使用。 我发现，在开发一个项目期间，数据索引的工作很困难而且很复杂。 When I was looking for solutions, I coincidentally got into the course. I felt that the SubQuery's framework was clear and easy to use, and my team and I had started developing with SubQuery since then which had greatly reduced our workload. SubQuery will be an important tool in our subsequent projects."_ - Peng, Student Representative

One Block+ developed the world's first substrate developers course with engineers from Parity Asia and are recognised as leaders in blockchain education within China and around the world.

> _"SubQuery is excited to continue our partnership with OneBlock+ and their passionate group of Chinese Substrate developers. We have already received feedback that the first group of students are already using SubQuery on their own projects to make their development easier. We look forward to collaborating with the future students as they leverage on OneBlock+ and SubQuery to build the next generation of dApps"_ - Sam Zou, Founder and CEO of SubQuery

More information on the upcoming dates will be published in [SubQuery's Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/78zg8aBSMG).

In the meantime, SubQuery will be participating in the [upcoming Gitcoin GR13 Hackathon and invites developers to participate](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr13/onboard) in the bounties here [or via bounties directly running in the SubQuery Grants Programme](https://subquery.network/grants).

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications. The protocol abstracts away blockchain data idiosyncrasies with the SubQuery SDK, allowing developers to focus on deploying their core product without needlessly wasting efforts on custom backend technologies.
