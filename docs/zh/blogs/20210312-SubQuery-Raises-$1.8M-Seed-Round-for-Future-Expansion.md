**SubQuery，让分散化数据更易于查询，现在我们已成功通过种子轮和私人销售筹集到了180万美元的启动资金，主要由** [**DeFi Alliance**](https://defialliance.co/)**** [**D1 Ventures**](https://d1.ventures/)**,** [**Hypersphere Ventures**](https://hypersphere.ventures/)**,** [**Digital Finance Group (DFG)**](https://www.dfg.group/)和  [**The Lao**](https://www.thelao.io/)进行投资。 我们收到了支持SubQuery种子轮的大量需求，这也表明了人们对区块链基础设施服务的浓厚兴趣，以及对Polkadot生态系统的未来充满信心。

SubQuery允许每个Substrate/Polkadot团队处理和查询他们的数据。 The project is inspired by the growth of data protocols serving the application layer and its aim is to help Polkadot/Substrate projects build better dApps by allowing anyone to reliably find and consume data faster. Today, anyone can query and extract Polkadot network data in only minutes and at no cost.

They are a front-runner in this area as their customer base includes some of the top Polkadot projects. The Subquery team is also one of the most passionate teams in crypto we’ve come across. We are excited to support them.”_ — Imran Khan, Partner at the DeFi Alliance

This seed raise will supercharge the development of SubQuery and accelerate the delivery of critical data services to the Polkadot/Substrate community. This includes building a free public service to host and manage community SubQuery projects, building a community around data and knowledge sharing, and the eventual tokenization of our project.
