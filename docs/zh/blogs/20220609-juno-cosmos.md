# SubQuery Unveils Cosmos Data Indexing via Juno Integration

Fresh from its recent announcement of its beta version implementation for Avalanche, SubQuery has delivered its latest iteration of multi-chain connectivity with the addition of support for the Cosmos ecosystem, starting with Juno.

From today, Juno and other CosmWasm developers will be able to access the beta of the same fast, flexible, and open indexing solution widely used across the Polkadot and Avalanche ecosystems.

This includes the open-source SDK, tools, [documentation](https://doc.subquery.network/), developer support, and other benefits developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem, including eligibility to participate in [SubQuery's Grants Programme](https://subquery.network/grants). Additionally, Juno is accommodated by SubQuery's managed service, which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles over 400 million requests each day.

[Juno](https://www.junonetwork.io/) is a decentralised, public, and permissionless layer 1 for cross-chain smart contracts. Via its powerful hub employing a standardised communication protocol, it aims to be the internet of blockchains, benchmarking inter-chain security for network participants. Built on Cosmos, Juno facilitates blockchain interoperability in an ever-growing multi-chain environment.

Jake Hartnell, the founder of another up-and-coming Cosmos chain, Stargaze, as well as a core Juno contributor, has shared _"We were elated to learn that SubQuery were expanding their invaluable data indexing services over to Juno. Our shared mission is to provide new teams with an environment to scale without hindrance and we know that SubQuery saves developers time and effort, allowing them to accelerate even faster."_

SubQuery provides decentralised data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains. As an open data indexer that is flexible and fast, the open indexing tool helps developers build APIs in hours and quickly index chains with the assistance of dictionaries (pre-computed indices).

Engineered for multi-chain applications, SubQuery's tools allow developers to organize, store, and query on-chain data for their protocols and applications. SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience.

SubQuery has already established itself as a data indexing solution on Polkadot, serving hundreds of millions of queries daily for projects like Moonbeam and Acala. This growth has spurred SubQuery to develop a priority list of six other Layer-1 blockchains they intend to serve in 2022.

The addition of the Cosmos ecosystem alongside [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and [Avalanche](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20220321-avalache.html) aligns with SubQuery's focus on networks that are also designed with a multi-chain outlook. While SubQuery's Cosmos implementation begins with [Juno](https://www.junonetwork.io), the product will eventually work with any [CosmWasm-based chain](https://cosmwasm.com/), including [Cronos](https://cronos.org/), [OKExChain](https://www.okex.com/), [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/), [Secret Network](https://scrt.network/), [Stargaze](https://stargaze.zone/), and [Injective](https://injective.com/).

[Sam Zou](https://twitter.com/zoujialiu), the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, comments, _"SubQuery is a fundamental piece of web3 infrastructure and we are delighted to support the explosive growth occurring in Cosmos and its native layers. We can't wait to see how teams in the Juno ecosystem leverage SubQuery's leading-edge indexing technology to build fast and feature-rich dApps."_

In just a few months, Juno applications will be able to decentralise their SubQuery infrastructure completely with the SubQuery Network. The SubQuery Network will index and serve project data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable manner. Designed to support any SubQuery project from any layer-1 network, including Juno and Cosmos, developers can leverage the scale of the unified SubQuery Network from launch.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
