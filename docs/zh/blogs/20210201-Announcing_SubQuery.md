# SubQuery 公告

## 转换并查询全球未来的 web3.0 数据

OnFinality 的任务是通过向所有类型和体量的客户提供基础设施服务来支持区块链开发人员。 我们正在启动一个新的事业，旨在通过解决一个核心问题来推动这项任务：SubQuery。

几乎每个区块链都需要处理和查询数据。 蓬勃发展的 Polkadot 社区将需要这种服务，使他们能够很快可靠地找到和消费数据。 我们的项目受到 [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) 的启发，这项服务目前侧重于在以太坊上，它允许客户使用 GraphQL 来做到这一点。

由于去中心化的系统中跨网络查询数据是缓慢和艰难的。 为了实现 Web 3.0 的梦想，对于终端用户来说它将比中心化网络更快。 目前已有的协议，都在为自己的项目建立中心化的数据索引服务器，但这带来了三个问题：

- Polkadot/ Substrate 团队在构建下一款 dApp 的时候不应该去考虑创建和管理数据索引服务器。
- 各个团队将不断地复活造轮子；Polkadot 的可互用性的根本优势是避免这种情况发生。
- 我们认为，Substrate/Polkadot 生态系统即将达到与以太链为基础的同样的增长水平， 并且它将提供与以太坊一样的社区服务。

Subquery 的目的是帮助 Polkadot/Substrate 项目建立更好的 dApp ，让任何人都能更快地找到和索引数据。 我们的服务将允许用户提取、转换、保持和查询数据，以及在未来可以连接和提供数据。 而我们的目标是使之成为 Substrate/Polkadot 生态系统的核心基础设施，就像 The Graph 已经成为以太坊上的基础设施一样。

**SubQuery is here to help you transform and query the world’s data for a web3.0 future.**

For the Web 3.0 dream to be realised, it’s got to be as fast (if not faster) than centralised networks for the end user.

That’s why we’re incredibly proud to announce SubQuery, an open source project that allows users to run an indexer across their chain to build a dataset that can be queried with GraphQL. This suite of tools includes a command line interface to allow projects to generate their own SubQuery project, defining how the indexer should traverse and aggregate their own network. There’s a SubQuery node package that indexes the network and supports GraphQL queries. With the help of these tools, anyone can create and run queries easily.

**You can get started right away by following our example on the SubQuery Github repository: [_https://github.com/OnFinality-io/subql_](https://github.com/OnFinality-io/subql)**

Additionally, you can find out more by reading our [SubQuery docs](https://doc.subquery.network/) or visiting our new website at [https://subquery.network/](https://subquery.network/)

We’ll focus on building a managed hosted service based off this offering that will be more performant and scalable. We are going to provide trusty public infrastructure that will build a powerful productionised SubQuery node from an uploaded SubQuery project. The service will then index and persist the chain state, and provide a production GraphQL endpoint that can replace self-hosted implementations. We’re going to focus on this so that everyone else can focus on building and growing their dApp.

Once this is in place, our final phase is to tokenize the SubQuery business by building our own chain (likely parachain) for Polkadot. Although we’ll provide a similar billing model for enterprise and high consumption users (subscription plan with consumption levels), we’ll save this data to our chain to make it transparent to everyone and participating parties can stake for rewards as incentives. We’ll issue a governance token to provide stability to the chain and to allow the community to influence our direction and roadmap.

Despite over 10 years of development since bitcoin first started, centralised networks are still the mainstream. It’s largely due to the speed and cost of accessing and writing to the network. Ethereum made a huge step forward with decentralised smart contracts (and the Graph is an incredibly successful piece of infrastructure as a result), but the core network is struggling to mitigate transaction costs.

We saw Polkadot’s potential early and right from the start it felt natural to focus our efforts there. It solves Ethereum’s governance, forking, interoperability problems, and more. The core premise of Polkadot is to create a thriving community of developers, users, and businesses that will tap into its multichain interoperability — that community is going to need a service that allows them to reliably find and consume data quickly.

Polkadot’s unique architecture means that we can focus on one network and then be able to support multiple current and future chains with ease. By putting in this effort now, even as Polkadot is still under development, we will be there ready to help the next generation of blockchain developers create the next big dApp.

SubQuery will be built by the team at OnFinality, which is an infrastructure SaaS platform for blockchain teams and users to launch nodes and get access to a large range of blockchain protocols. We have a suite of symbiotic services including our API shared node service, and dedicated nodes that can be used in infrastructure management or as part of a protocol team’s CI/CD testing pipeline. We have relationships with the top Polkadot/Substrate teams, expertise in managed infrastructure hosting for the Substrate/Polkadot network, and the ability to deliver complex infrastructure projects and host them for production use.
