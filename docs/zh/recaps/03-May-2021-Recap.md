我们一直在与许多协议、DeFi应用、dApp、Wallet、NFT平台、跨链桥以及更多波尔卡多特生态系统进行接触。 我们正在计划改进我们的新合作伙伴的驾临过程，以通过示例代码、准备好的项目以及为开发者提供更好的信息来加快这一速度。

**Expect the stream of new partner projects to turn into a flood.**

At the end of May we now have a total of 48 SubQuery projects hosted on SubQuery including:

- [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io/) (我们将与之密切合作的主要 Polkadot 钱包)，
- [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/) 以及[NFTMart](https://www.nftmart.io/) (NFT 平台)
- [Darwinia](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/darwinia) (交叉链桥) 和它的测试网络 [Crab](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/wuminzhe/crab)

Take a look at what Darwinia said about us

> _“Using SubQuery to query Darwinia’s on-chain data has become very simple and flexible. SubQuery regards blockchain data as a graph, and leverages the extensibility of GraphQL to introduce additional functionality. We believe that in the future, the data interface on the substrate chain will mainly use GraphQL, SubQuery is making this a reality”_ — [Darwinia](../customer_announcements/20210528-Darwinias-Network-Data-is-Now-Available-for-Free-on-SubQuery.md)

There is so much potential at SubQuery, so many ideas we are building, and so many partners that we’re onboarding that we need to massively expand our team. We’ve just added 4 employees across UX, marketing, business development, and engineering but need to keep adding more.

SubQuery was selected from over 50 candidates to join the exclusive 2021 Web 3.0 Bootcamp in Shanghai. There are some amazing projects and a huge amount of talent in this bootcamp, so we’re excited to be a part of it. Polkadot is the most exciting ecosystem out there in our industry, and China is the fastest growing country building here.

We expect to learn a lot, to make a lot of new friends and partners, to get a lot of feedback on our product development. We expect to come out of this bootcamp even stronger than we are now. You can watch our opening ceremony below

Next month we’ve got some exciting new announcements to share with our community, stay subscribed to our social media channels to hear about them first.
