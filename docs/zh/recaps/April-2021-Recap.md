# 2021年4月回顾

对于SubQuery来说，四月是非常忙碌的一个月，我们的增长速度开始加快，每天都在打破新的记录。正如我们上个月提到的，短期内我们的重点是两个要素;扩大我们的平台以跟上飞速增长的需求，另一方面是和越来越多的合作伙伴合作，帮助他们创建自己的SubQuery项目。 正如我们上个月提到的那样，我们短期内的重点是两个方面。 扩大我们的平台以跟上飞速上涨的需求，并与越来越多的伙伴进行接触，帮助它们创建自己的 SubQuery 项目。

在本月更新中：

-   聚焦于合作伙伴工具——SubQuery 项目启动
-   BiFrost SubQuery 使用案件
-   我们的服务提供商OnFinality在可伸缩性上的改进
-   其他更多信息...

在辅助产品方面，我们启用了一个关键产品，这是加速SubQuery增长所需的。 在此之前，您只能在本地或在自己的基础设施中创建和运行您自己的 SubQuery 项目。 [Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) 允许用户向SubQuery社区发布他们的项目，我们将以高性能运行它们。 可扩展和管理的公共服务——它们是完全免费的！

这最后一个缺失的部分现在意味着我们有一个完整的工具套件来支持和授权客户去 [探索](https://explorer.subquery.network/), [创建](https://doc.subquery.network/quickstart.html), [运行](https://doc.subquery.network/run/indexing_query.html), and then [发布](https://doc.subquery.network/publish/publish.html#benefits)他们自己的SubQuery项目

In April, [Bifrost Finance](https://bifrost.finance/) launched the beta of their new dApp, the official interactive interface for all Bifrost services. Through this dApp, users can mint vTokens, redeem and swap these derivatives, and view their earnings in real time. Through this dApp, users can mint vTokens, redeem and swap these derivatives, and view their earnings in real time.

SubQuery’s service helps Bifrost power much of the data shown in their new dApp. All historical data on transfers, minting, and redemption events (such as price, date, currency and pool) are aggregated and queried from SubQuery’s advanced indexing and query service. For example, SubQuery allows Bifrost to calculate real time mint and redemption prices for vDot and vEth to show in their app, and to get the total number of vTokens in a certain wallet.

> “Without SubQuery, it is difficult to imagine how complicated it is to manually collect data from the chain. Bifrost developers may spend a lot of time searching for all transaction data on chain to be used for transaction history. SubQuery helps developers save a lot of repetitive work costs. Bifrost will cooperate with SubQuery for a long time to accelerate the iterative speed of product development”. — Bifrost Finance

OnFinality is a key service provider for SubQuery — most of the SubQuery indexers in Polkadot and Kusama projects are using OnFinality’s public API endpoints to get their data. The significant traffic from SubQuery is one of the reasons why OnFinality is the largest infrastructure provider in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.

In April, OnFinality hit a long term goal of 100 million in a single day, in fact they smashed it with 127 million requests in 24 hours (almost 1,500 each second).

OnFinality also [delivered their treasury proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/72) for the second milestone to improve the scalability of their API service. Intelligent routing that allows them to maximise the use of different clusters of nodes across their user base in different geographic regions. SubQuery relies on this infrastructure so it’s important to note the continued investment and improvements here. The past month has demonstrated how critical it is to continue to invest in scale so that we can continue to provide the best service every day.

-   Our CEO Sam Zou presented _Cyber future on Parachains_ online event with Web3, Acala, Polkawarriors, and Bitfwd

-   Our Head of Business Development James Bayly joined an interesting virtual fireside chat with DFG and James Wo as part of their DFG Talks series.

-   Our time in the Berkeley Xcelerator has started — we’ve attended some excellent sessions so far
-   We’ve made some big improvements to our [SubQuery website](https://subquery.network/)
-   A new release of [improved documentation](https://doc.subquery.network/) for SubQuery developers
-   Our offices are improving, we’re lucky to be able to work in the same space here in New Zealand
