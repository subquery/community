# SubQuery Delivers its Open Source SDK Following a Web3 Foundation Grant

## Developers can now transform and query the world’s data for the Web3 future

This week OnFinality (the team behind SubQuery), delivered on their Web3 Foundation Grant to provide a complete workflow to create SubQuery projects. We’re excited to announce the work that we’ve done to complete this grant, and to share it with the world so that they can start using our project today to query their networks more efficiently.

SubQuery is built by the team at OnFinality, which is an infrastructure Iaas & SaaS platform for blockchain teams and users to launch nodes and get access to a large range of blockchain protocols. We have a suite of symbiotic services including our API shared node services, and have relationships with the top Polkadot/Substrate teams.

Almost every blockchain has a need to process and query data. Our project is inspired by the growth of data protocols serving the application layer and is here to help the thriving Polkadot community. SubQuery’s aim is to help Polkadot/Substrate projects build better dApps by allowing anyone to reliably find and consume data faster. Our service allows users to extract, transform, persist, and query data, as well as connect and present data in the future.

The [Web3 Foundation Open Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/136) has enabled us to build SubQuery, an open source project that allows users to run an indexer across their chain to build a dataset that can be queried with GraphQL.

This suite of tools includes @subql/cli, to allow projects to generate their own SubQuery project, defining how the indexer should traverse and aggregate their own network. As part of our proposal, we have provided a basic tutorial that shows users how to use the cli to index their network that [you can follow here](https://doc.subquery.network/quickstart.html). We’ve even provided more detailed developer documentation for more advanced usages.

Secondly, there’s a SubQuery node package that loads the defined SubQuery project created by the CLI and then indexes the network to a Postgres database. Using Hasura, you can run GraphQL queries right away over indexed tables. With the help of these tools, and the community support material that we’re always improving, anyone can create and run queries easily.

**You can get started right away by following our example on the** [**SubQuery Github repository**](https://github.com/OnFinality-io/subql)**. Additionally, you can find out more by reading our** [**SubQuery docs**](https://doc.subquery.network/) **or** [**visiting our new website**](https://subquery.network/)**.**

We’re incredibly grateful for the support provided by Web3 Foundation to help us carry out this project for the community. Web3 Foundation funds research and development teams building the technology stack of the decentralized web. It was established in Zug, Switzerland by Ethereum co-founder and former chief technology officer Dr. Gavin Wood. Polkadot is the Foundation’s flagship project.

We’ll focus on building a managed hosted service based off this offering that will be more performant and scalable. We are going to provide trusty public infrastructure that will build a powerful productionised SubQuery node from an uploaded SubQuery project. The service will then index and persist the chain state, and provide a production GraphQL endpoint that can replace self-hosted implementations. We’re going to focus on this so that everyone else can focus on building and growing their dApp.

We saw Polkadot’s potential early and right from the start it felt natural to focus our efforts there. The core premise of Polkadot is to create a thriving community of developers, users, and businesses that will tap into its multichain interoperability — that community is going to need a service that allows them to reliably find and consume data quickly.

Polkadot’s unique architecture means that we can focus on one network and then be able to support multiple current and future chains with ease. Even though Polkadot is still under development, we will be there ready to help the next generation of blockchain developers create the next big dApp.
