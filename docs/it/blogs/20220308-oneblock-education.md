# SubQuery Extends Partnership with OneBlock+ To Promote Blockchain Education in China

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*vr-DzLokDkkiY4ss)

Today we are excited to announce the continuation of our partnership with OneBlock+ to run a second round of the ["Hero Course"](https://doc.subquery.network/academy/herocourse/) in China starting in early April.

SubQuery's mission of making the world's decentralised data more accessible relies on having a network of developers who are familiar with the solution. OneBlock+ are a recognised leader in blockchain education in China and helped us run a tailored version of our existing course renamed "SubQuery for Beginners --- To Learn Blockchain Data Indexing in an Easy Way."

The course took in 90 students who participated in six lessons running from 10th January until the graduation ceremony on 28 February. The first batch of students learnt via WeChat and live Technical Workshops as part of their regular Substrate Saturday programme. OneBlock+ also provided additional learning support to students via weekly "Office Hours" on Tencent's Conference platform.

> _"Thanks to OneBlock+ and SubQuery for creating such a great course. The curriculum is good and I was able to master the use of SubQuery by completing the course. I found it was difficult and complex for data indexing during the development of a project. When I was looking for solutions, I coincidentally got into the course. I felt that the SubQuery's framework was clear and easy to use, and my team and I had started developing with SubQuery since then which had greatly reduced our workload. SubQuery will be an important tool in our subsequent projects."_ - Peng, Student Representative

One Block+ developed the world's first substrate developers course with engineers from Parity Asia and are recognised as leaders in blockchain education within China and around the world.

> _"SubQuery is excited to continue our partnership with OneBlock+ and their passionate group of Chinese Substrate developers. We have already received feedback that the first group of students are already using SubQuery on their own projects to make their development easier. We look forward to collaborating with the future students as they leverage on OneBlock+ and SubQuery to build the next generation of dApps"_ - Sam Zou, Founder and CEO of SubQuery

More information on the upcoming dates will be published in [SubQuery's Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/78zg8aBSMG).

In the meantime, SubQuery will be participating in the [upcoming Gitcoin GR13 Hackathon and invites developers to participate](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr13/onboard) in the bounties here [or via bounties directly running in the SubQuery Grants Programme](https://subquery.network/grants).

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications.
