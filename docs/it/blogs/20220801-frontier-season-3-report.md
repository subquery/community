Last week SubQuery crossed a huge milestone in its development of the SubQuery Network with the completion of Season 3 of the Frontier testnet! This period marks the closure of a critical season of our test network, as we race towards the launch of the SubQuery Network.

Season 3 of the SubQuery Frontier testnet had the following goals:

- To test out the quality of our documentation, software, and applications so that thousands of participants can join and participate equally in our network
- To run our smart contracts on Acala's new EVM+ and confirm that everything is working as expected and performing well
- To learn more about how our network operates under real-world conditions, and continue to fix bugs and release new features and improvements

This testnet was completely open to the public, anyone was able to request tokens from our faucet, and was able to participate as an Indexer, Delegator, or Consumer. In the end thousands of people joined the network and we achieved all of our goals.

With 2,361 active indexers participating within our network, we believe this may be one of the largest test networks ever run. It shows how easy SubQuery made the infrastructure setup process through great documentation, onboarding guides, community support, and indexer services.

Another first for this iteration of the test network was that it indexed projects from three different layer-one chains within the same decentralised network. This could be another first by combining data from three different networks into one place. In season 3, we had three projects from Polkadot, Avalanche and Cosmos (Juno) being indexed by the same participants simultaneously.

One of the best aspects of the Testnet is that the [explorer ](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/subquery/subquery-network-query-registry)that you see retrieves data directly from a SubQuery project. This is the ultimate test of our own tools and software, where we've built a complex project and run it in our own infrastructure to power our own application, just like how our customers do.

In summary, season 3 gives us the confidence that the SubQuery Network is truly multichain, it's simple and accessible, and that we are ready to start innovating in payment methods. From here we are now ready to launch the [SubQuery Kepler Network](./20220712-public-sale-postponed.md), you can expect more information about this soon but the main aim of this is to migrate real projects from our managed service to the decentralised SubQuery Kepler Network while providing real world incentives to all participants.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
