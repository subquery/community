**Polkadotのリーディング・データ・インデクサーがGitcoin Grants Round 12に参加します。**

SubQuery Academyの「ヒーローコース」の圧倒的な成功を受けて、12月1日からGitcoin Grants Round 12を通じて、すべての開発者に初のハッカソンの機会を提供することになりました。

世界の分散型データをよりアクセスしやすくするというSubQueryのミッションは、Substrate/Polkadotのエコシステムの中で創造と革新を行う権限を与えられた開発者のネットワークを持つことにかかっています。 Gitcoinとのパートナーシップは、世界中の意欲的な開発者に未来のアプリケーションを構築する機会を提供するという、私たちのコミットメントを反映したものです。

The  [Gitcoin GR12 Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr12/onboard)  takes place from December 1st — 16th 2021 with leading blockchain projects contributing to various prize pools.  [SubQuery has proposed 5 bounties with a total prize pool of up to $34,000](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr12/?org=subquery).

[Sam Zou](https://twitter.com/zoujialiu), the CEO and Founder of SubQuery commented,  _“SubQuery is proud to partner with the Gitcoin GR12 Hackathon to build the future of Web3.0. As the leading data indexer in the Polkadot ecosystem we strongly believe in building tools that allow dApp developers to focus on their front-end, so they don’t need to waste time on building a custom server for data processing. The bounties we have developed reflect our desire to give opportunities for graduates of our ‘Hero Course’ and more advanced challenges for experienced developers”_

As part of the GR 12 Hackathon, SubQuery will be running workshops at the beginner and advanced level to help familiarise developers with our platform. In the meantime, you can  [learn how to build applications in about SubQuery via the SubQuery Academy](https://subquery.coassemble.com/unlock/dOKZW6O#/).
