最近では、Polkadotのエコシステムの中で、多くのプロトコル、DeFiアプリ、dApps、ウォレット、NFTプラットフォーム、クロスチェーンブリッジなどに働きかけています。 新しいパートナーのためのオンボーディングプロセスを改善し、サンプルコードやすぐに作れるプロジェクト、開発者のためのより良い情報を提供することで、このプロセスをスピードアップすることを計画しています。

**Expect the stream of new partner projects to turn into a flood.**

At the end of May we now have a total of 48 SubQuery projects hosted on SubQuery including:

- [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io/)（Polkadotの代表的なウォレットで、これから密接に協力していく予定です）。
- [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/)、[NFTMart](https://www.nftmart.io/)（NFTプラットフォーム）。
- [Darwinia](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/darwinia)（クロスチェーンブリッジ）とそのテストネットワーク[Crab](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/wuminzhe/crab)。

Take a look at what Darwinia said about us

> _“Using SubQuery to query Darwinia’s on-chain data has become very simple and flexible. SubQuery regards blockchain data as a graph, and leverages the extensibility of GraphQL to introduce additional functionality. We believe that in the future, the data interface on the substrate chain will mainly use GraphQL, SubQuery is making this a reality”_ — [Darwinia](../customer_announcements/20210528-Darwinias-Network-Data-is-Now-Available-for-Free-on-SubQuery.md)

There is so much potential at SubQuery, so many ideas we are building, and so many partners that we’re onboarding that we need to massively expand our team. We’ve just added 4 employees across UX, marketing, business development, and engineering but need to keep adding more.

SubQuery was selected from over 50 candidates to join the exclusive 2021 Web 3.0 Bootcamp in Shanghai. There are some amazing projects and a huge amount of talent in this bootcamp, so we’re excited to be a part of it. Polkadot is the most exciting ecosystem out there in our industry, and China is the fastest growing country building here.

We expect to learn a lot, to make a lot of new friends and partners, to get a lot of feedback on our product development. We expect to come out of this bootcamp even stronger than we are now. You can watch our opening ceremony below

Next month we’ve got some exciting new announcements to share with our community, stay subscribed to our social media channels to hear about them first.
