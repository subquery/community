**We are pleased to announce that SubQuery and Darwinia Network have formed a strategic partnership.**

[Darwinia](https://darwinia.network/) recently released two new SubQuery projects, one for their [main network](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/darwinia) and the other for [Crab](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/crab), their canary network. By exposing their data on SubQuery, Darwinia is opening the door for their application ecosystem to build more engaging applications on this free datasource.

> “Using SubQuery to query Darwinia’s on-chain data has become very simple and flexible. SubQuery regards blockchain data as a graph, and leverages the extensibility of GraphQL to introduce additional functionality. We believe that in the future, the data interface on the substrate chain will mainly use GraphQL, SubQuery is making this a reality”. — Darwinia

[SubQuery’s](https://subquery.network/) service helps Darwinia unlock chain data and to make it more accessible for their application ecosystem. Applications, for example a NFT marketplace, could use the data from Darwnia’s SubQuery to show auction statistics, and could even extend the Darwinia SubQuery project to aggregate and transform data to provide even more unique data insights.

Thanks to SubQuery, we can easily query the transfer times of each account on the chain. For example, we can get the three account with the most sent and receive transactions through the query below:

Darwinia is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services for this service is completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/). You can play around with the Darwinia SubQuery dataset here (and Darwinia’s Crab here) using the Explorer without implementing any code. As you wish, obtaining the records of a specific account would become very simple.

The query indicates that we need to get the latest 20 records whether is sending or receiving with the address _2qeMxq616BhqvTW8a1bp2g7VKPAmpda1vXuAAz5TxV5ehivG_.

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data aggregation layer that will operate between the layer-1 blockchains (Darwinia) and DApps. The solution aggregates and organises data from [Darwinia](https://darwinia.network/) and other blockchains, serving up well-structured data for their dApp and for other developers to use in a wide array of projects. This service allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.

The Darwinia Network is a decentralized heterogeneous cross-chain bridge protocol built on Substrate, focusing on decentralized cross-chain token swap, exchange and market.

Darwinia also serves as critical infrastructure for single-chain application upgrade to cross-chain version, including Defi, Game, DEX, NFT market, etc. Their vision is to build the future Internet of Tokens.
