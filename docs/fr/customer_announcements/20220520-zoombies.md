Aujourd'hui, nous voulons mettre en lumière le succès de [Zoombies](https://zoombies.world/), un autre bénéficiaire du [Programme de subventions SubQuery](https://subquery.network/grants). Zoombies est une plateforme de mint NFT basée sur Moonriver (et bientôt Moonbeam) et conçue sur mesure, entrelacée avec une dynamique de jeu play2earn. Les avantages du programme de subventions SubQuery ont permis à l'équipe de Zoombies d'élever son projet au niveau supérieur en accédant à l'historique complet des données des événements passés pour produire des informations significatives qui enrichissent l'expérience du joueur

Le lancement du programme de subventions SubQuery a eu lieu à un moment où Zoombies avait réussi à obtenir des résultats substantiels, mais avait en vue certaines améliorations qui s'avéraient difficiles. Du point de vue de l'indexation des données, SubQuery a pu intervenir et résoudre un problème qui empêchait Zoombies de répondre aux besoins et aux souhaits de sa communauté. Zoombies players were requesting detailed information such as the scarcity and owner history of their NFT, minting/burning information on each collection and the inflation/deflation rate of the native Zoom token over time. These requests ultimately relied on the provision of seamless and accurate data which, in the blockchain world, is no small feat.

> _"Zoombies were the ideal candidate for the SubQuery Grants Programme as they were not searching solely for funding, instead their needs encompassed all of the benefits that the programme offers. They've been extremely receptive and responsive throughout the mentoring process and we have been consistently impressed by their output in each milestone."_ - James Bayly, Head of Business Development at SubQuery

With each milestone achievement, the Zoombies team delivered the player enrichment features that their community had been calling out for. For milestone two the team added card collection statistics for each NFT including features such as card scarcity rating, total minted and total in circulation.

While in milestone 3 the Zoombies team rolled out a comprehensive game stats feature which would further excite the community as they can see the top five rarest / scarcest cards as well as a range of other data features such as 24 hour totals of cards minted and burned and Zoom token minted and burned.

> _"The SubQuery grants programme has been a very clear step-by-step reward-driven process which has given us a great boost in our confidence towards success with this project. The programme allowed us to define a detailed project framework and set of goals we could work towards. Delivery of these goals, provides a financial subsidy that in turn alleviates research and development costs typically faced when undertaking the risk of learning a new platform."_ - Ryan Price, Founder of Zoombies

The Zoombies team have built multiple SubQuery projects to service their needs which can all be found in the [SubQuery Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).
