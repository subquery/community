# SubQuery étend son partenariat avec OneBlock+ pour promouvoir l'enseignement de la blockchain en Chine

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*vr-DzLokDkkiY4ss)

Aujourd'hui, nous sommes heureux d'annoncer la poursuite de notre partenariat avec OneBlock+ pour organiser une deuxième série du ["Hero Course"](https://doc.subquery.network/academy/herocourse/) en Chine à partir de début avril.

La mission de SubQuery, qui consiste à rendre les données décentralisées du monde plus accessibles, repose sur un réseau de développeurs qui connaissent bien la solution. OneBlock+ est un leader reconnu de l'enseignement de la blockchain en Chine et nous a aidés à organiser une version adaptée de notre cours existant, rebaptisé "SubQuery for Beginners --- To Learn Blockchain Data Indexing in an Easy Way"

Le cours a accueilli 90 étudiants qui ont participé à six leçons du 10 janvier au 28 février, date de la cérémonie de remise des diplômes. Le premier groupe d'étudiants a appris via WeChat et des ateliers techniques en direct dans le cadre du programme régulier Substrate Saturday. OneBlock+ also provided additional learning support to students via weekly "Office Hours" on Tencent's Conference platform.

> _"Thanks to OneBlock+ and SubQuery for creating such a great course. The curriculum is good and I was able to master the use of SubQuery by completing the course. I found it was difficult and complex for data indexing during the development of a project. When I was looking for solutions, I coincidentally got into the course. I felt that the SubQuery's framework was clear and easy to use, and my team and I had started developing with SubQuery since then which had greatly reduced our workload. SubQuery will be an important tool in our subsequent projects."_ - Peng, Student Representative

One Block+ developed the world's first substrate developers course with engineers from Parity Asia and are recognised as leaders in blockchain education within China and around the world.

> _"SubQuery is excited to continue our partnership with OneBlock+ and their passionate group of Chinese Substrate developers. We have already received feedback that the first group of students are already using SubQuery on their own projects to make their development easier. We look forward to collaborating with the future students as they leverage on OneBlock+ and SubQuery to build the next generation of dApps"_ - Sam Zou, Founder and CEO of SubQuery

More information on the upcoming dates will be published in [SubQuery's Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/78zg8aBSMG).

In the meantime, SubQuery will be participating in the [upcoming Gitcoin GR13 Hackathon and invites developers to participate](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr13/onboard) in the bounties here [or via bounties directly running in the SubQuery Grants Programme](https://subquery.network/grants).

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications. The protocol abstracts away blockchain data idiosyncrasies with the SubQuery SDK, allowing developers to focus on deploying their core product without needlessly wasting efforts on custom backend technologies.
