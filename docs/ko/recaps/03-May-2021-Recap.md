무대 뒤에서 우리는 5월에 그 어느 때보다 바빴고, 팀을 확장하고, 제품을 제공했으며, 가장 중요한 것은 가능한 한 많은 파트너를 영입했습니다.

이번 월간 업데이트:

- 더 많은 SubQuery 파트너 참여
- 우리는 고용 중입니다!
- SubQuery는 Web3.0 Bootcamp의 일부입니다.

우리는 최근 Polkadot 생태계 전반에 걸쳐 많은 프로토콜, DeFi 앱, dApp, 지갑, NFT 플랫폼, 크로스체인 브리지 등에 접근하고 있습니다. 새로운 파트너가 예제 코드, 기성 프로젝트 및 개발자를 위한 더 나은 정보를 통해 속도를 높일 수 있도록 온보딩 프로세스를 개선할 계획입니다.

**Expect the stream of new partner projects to turn into a flood.**

At the end of May we now have a total of 48 SubQuery projects hosted on SubQuery including:

- [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io/)(우리가 긴밀히 협력할 선도적인 Polkadot 지갑),
- [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/) 및 [NFTMart](https://www.nftmart.io/)(NFT 플랫폼)
- [Darwinia](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/darwinia)(Cross Chain Bridge) 와 테스트 네트워크 [Crab](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/wuminzhe/crab)

Take a look at what Darwinia said about us

> _“Using SubQuery to query Darwinia’s on-chain data has become very simple and flexible. SubQuery regards blockchain data as a graph, and leverages the extensibility of GraphQL to introduce additional functionality. We believe that in the future, the data interface on the substrate chain will mainly use GraphQL, SubQuery is making this a reality”_ — [Darwinia](../customer_announcements/20210528-Darwinias-Network-Data-is-Now-Available-for-Free-on-SubQuery.md)

There is so much potential at SubQuery, so many ideas we are building, and so many partners that we’re onboarding that we need to massively expand our team. We’ve just added 4 employees across UX, marketing, business development, and engineering but need to keep adding more.

Please let us know if you can recommend anyone for any of the following roles, we’re looking for the best to join us on our journey 🚀

SubQuery was selected from over 50 candidates to join the exclusive 2021 Web 3.0 Bootcamp in Shanghai. There are some amazing projects and a huge amount of talent in this bootcamp, so we’re excited to be a part of it. Polkadot is the most exciting ecosystem out there in our industry, and China is the fastest growing country building here.

We expect to learn a lot, to make a lot of new friends and partners, to get a lot of feedback on our product development. We expect to come out of this bootcamp even stronger than we are now. You can watch our opening ceremony below

Next month we’ve got some exciting new announcements to share with our community, stay subscribed to our social media channels to hear about them first.
