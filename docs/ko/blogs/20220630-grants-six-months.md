# SubQuery Grants Programme Celebrates Six Months of Polkadot Ecosystem Support

Upon [launching the SubQuery Grants Programme](./20211222-grants.md) right at the close of 2021, SubQuery is proud to shine a light on what has been a fruitful and rewarding first six months. With an initial allocation of US$500,000 funding, SubQuery was excited to offer key opportunities to blockchain developers, community members, and wider ecosystem participants so they can create the next-generation of decentralized applications (dApps).

The vision of the SubQuery Grants Programme was to bolster new teams with a strong idea but lacking the tools, connections and funding to progress their vision. Participants could elect to submit their own proposal for a grant or select technical bounties promoted by SubQuery.

Given SubQuery's deep connections with the leading teams in Polkadot, we were able to create an exciting list of technical bounty ideas that would elevate the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem via our partnerships with leading teams such as Moonbeam, Acala, Astar, and Bifrost. [We launched these technical bounties as part of the SubQuery Grants Programme](./20220127-grants-bounties.md) so that individuals/teams could apply and, if selected, receive funding as well as close cooperation with both SubQuery and the ecosystem partner who contributed the bounty idea.

## Our Progress So Far

After an influx of applications, the programme hit the ground running with its [first cohort of grant recipients](./20220223-grants-first-cohort.md). Since then, SubQuery is working closely with eight teams giving them the guidance they need to bring their Web3 vision to life.

Since the inception of the programme, we've celebrated 15 milestone completions and paid out $139,335 for these achievements. [Dapplooker was the first to graduate the grants programme](../customer_announcements/20220425-dapplooker-grant.md) and now offer their solution of beautiful and easy-to-build analytic tools such as explorers, charts and dashboards on top of any SubQuery dataset. The [next team to graduate was Zoombies](../customer_announcements/20220520-zoombies.md), who elevated their gaming/NFT project by using SubQuery to access the complete history of past event data to produce meaningful insights that enriched their player experience.

Several technical bounties have also been completed, including a [Discord Bot for Phala Delegate/Mining which was recently ](https://twitter.com/phalanetwork/status/1525023207371468800?s=21)lauded for the benefits it brought to their community.

## What's Next?

The vision for the SubQuery Grants Programme is to have it grow and evolve alongside SubQuery. One aspect of this growth is SubQuery's multi-chain mission, beginning with the [expansion into Avalanche](./20220321-avalache.md), and followed by our [recently announced support for Cosmos](./20220609-juno-cosmos.md). This means the programme will no longer focus solely on builders working in Polkadot but with each layer-1 expansion for SubQuery we will accept applications into the SubQuery Grants Programme that are looking to make a difference in these ecosystems and also need support.

SubQuery also announced [the establishment of the SubQuery Foundation](./20220617-foundation-launch.md) recently. One of the functions of the foundation is to support the growth of the SubQuery Network ecosystem and in that vein, the existing Grants Programme will migrate to be under the Foundation's purview. It is envisaged that the [SubQuery Foundation](https://www.subquery.foundation/) will be providing additional funding support for grants once the original US$500,000 budget has been exhausted.

If you don't have your own submission for a Grant there are still over [15 bounties available ](https://subquery.network/grants)which have been contributed by top-tier teams such as; Moonbeam, Acala, Bifrost, Astar, Phala and RMRK. We can't wait to hear from you!

## 서브쿼리란

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is the Universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
