# SubQuery Expands Indexing Support in Cosmos with OKC (OKX Chain) Integration

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*TrBYyP8IRJ5e5gnH)

SubQuery's goal has always been to provide fast and efficient indexing to the widest variety of chains possible. Today we're proud to announce we've started supporting another Cosmos chain: OKC (OKX Chain)!

OKC ([OKX Chain)](https://www.okx.com/okc) is an EVM-compatible L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability (IBC) and maximized performance. At high scalability, developers can build and scale with low gas fees. The OKC ecosystem and infrastructure, including the all-in-one multi-chain Web3 interface, enables a seamless experience for both developers and users.

SubQuery's flexible, fast, open, and decentralised data indexing solution provides developers with the tools needed to easily organise and query on-chain data for their protocol and applications. Abstracting the backend, SubQuery provides a custom API and lets developers focus on product development and user experience rather than building their own indexing solutions.

> Nicholas Soong, the Director of OKX Chain Ecosystem Development in APAC, said: *"SubQuery's decentralized data indexing infrastructure will increase the efficiency in which developers can develop their products on OKC. This fits the ethos in which we are looking to build our chain upon and we are excited to have SubQuery on-board within our ever-growing ecosystem."*

OKC will benefit from the full SubQuery experience, including the open-source SDK, tools, [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos.html), developer support, and other benefits developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem.

Additionally, OKC is accommodated by [SubQuery's managed service](https://subquery.network/managedservices), which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles over 400 million requests each day.

> Sam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, said: *"SubQuery is a fundamental piece of web3 infrastructure that will now be supporting yet another Cosmos chain, OKC (OKX Chain). OKC developers will benefit from our fast, flexible and universal blockchain indexing toolkit that is designed to make their lives easier. We can't wait to see all of the exciting dApps that will be built on OKC with the power of SubQuery."*

SubQuery provides decentralised data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains. As an open data indexer that is flexible and fast, the open indexing tool helps developers build APIs in hours and quickly index chains with the assistance of dictionaries (pre-computed indices).

Engineered for multi-chain applications, SubQuery's tools allow developers to organize, store, and query on-chain data for their protocols and applications. SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience.

Now, the open-source SubQuery software-development-kit (SDK) not only supports EVM, WASM and CosmWasm smart contracts, it fully supports the Ethermint EVM implementation, including custom application binary interfaces (ABI's) and smart contracts.

After establishing itself as the leading data indexing solution on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), by serving hundreds of millions of queries daily, SubQuery has expanded to serve other Layer-1 blockchains such as the [Cosmos](./20220909-cosmoshub.md) ecosystem alongside [Algorand](./20220713-algorand.md), [Flare ](./20221202-flare.md)and [Avalanche](./20220321-avalache.md).

## 서브쿼리란

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, Cosmos and Flare projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
