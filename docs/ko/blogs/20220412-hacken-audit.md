# SubQuery Network Passes Smart Contract Audit by Hacken

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*EbIDDKebNpv2DBC9)

Today we are pleased to announce that the smart contracts of the SubQuery Network have passed the audit procedures of Hacken. [Hacken is a leading security consulting company](https://hacken.io/) with a focus on blockchain security and will play an important role in the eventual decentralisation of SubQuery's indexing service.

As we [announced in our roadmap](./20211029-roadmap-october.md), SubQuery has a number of key technical hurdles to overcome before we can evolve into the SubQuery Network. Taking a sophisticated code-base that is servicing millions of API queries across dozens of leading projects in Polkadot and migrating that to a completely new environment in real-time, while keeping it secure, is no small feat! We feel confident that we have now achieved this and recently appointed Hacken to conduct a thorough code audit to confirm that the network's code is secure and scalable.

Commenting on the importance of the partnership with Hacken, Ian He, CTO of SubQuery, shared, _"SubQuery has established itself as a critical part of Polkadot's infrastructure and we are excited to have had Hacken validate our smart-contract security as it means we are one step closer to our vision of leading a Web3 data revolution"_.

The scope of the audit incorporated both a Code and Functional Review performed by a team of Hacken's renowned consultants to find and fix security issues from hacker attacks. During their analysis, Hacken ensured the smart contract's functionality and determined whether it could withstand all known vulnerabilities. In both cases, SubQuery passed and verified that it does not have any logic or access control issues, and that it is compliant with the Solidity Code Style Guide.

Passing the first phase of the audit will give comfort to our community and those indexers participating in the first season of the [recently launched "Frontier" testnet](./20220330-frontier-testnet.md).

## 서브쿼리란

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot , Substrate and Avalanche projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
