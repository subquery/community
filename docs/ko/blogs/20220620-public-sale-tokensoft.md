![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*xDmQKP6rTqTXVpx6)

SubQuery Network, the leading data indexing solution on Polkadot, is delighted to announce the selection of [TokenSoft](https://www.tokensoft.io/) as its official token sale launchpad partner. TokenSoft is recognised as one of the leading technology platforms for creating and managing digital assets.

Following [the announcement of The SubQuery Foundation](./20220617-foundation-launch.md) , one of the next priorities was to select a suitable launchpad for the token sale for our Public Sale. After careful due diligence, SubQuery selected TokenSoft's platform based on their outstanding technical expertise and [their track record of supporting projects participating in the Polkadot parachain auctions](https://blog.tokensoft.io/tokensoft-announces-support-for-polkadot-parachains-fbb0bf317125?gi=20d3d7c28f52).

Simultaneously, [we recently launched the SubQuery Foundation's website](https://subquery.foundation/) that also hosts the [SQT Public Sale page](https://www.subquery.foundation/publicsale) with information about the sale.

Sam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery remarked: *"SubQuery is excited to appoint TokenSoft as our partner for our token sale. One reason is that TokenSoft are renowned as a leader in asset tokenisation, but more importantly this partnership paves the way for our community to finally have a stake in the Web3 infrastructure of the SubQuery Network."*

As outlined in the [recent article on SQT tokenomics](./20211220-tokenomics.md), we have allocated 12% of the total token supply across for three sequential rounds for the Public Sale. The first round will be invite-only with guaranteed allocation for community members (e.g. [Ambassadors](./20210713-Introducing-the-SubQuery-Ambassador-Program.md), Spartans) and key network participants (e.g. [test network participants](./20211202-indexer-invitation.md) and referenceable customers). The second round will be open to all interested parties on a first come first served basis and have a max cap. If there are any unsold tokens, we will open the third found on a first come first served basis without the max cap. The exact structure and timing of these rounds will be published over the coming days.

In order to participate in the SQT Public Sale, all interested parties, including the whitelisted users, will need to register on TokenSoft's platform and complete their know-your-customer (KYC) process in order to qualify for the SQT sale here ([tokensoft.io](https://community.tokensoft.io/)). We have prepared a step-by-step walkthrough for the KYC process - [please access it here](https://sqt-guide.subquery.foundation/sqt-public-sale/).

We recommend completing the registration at the earliest, effective immediately. Note that citizens of the USA, China, New Zealand and a few other countries, unfortunately, will not be able to participate.

Over the next couple of weeks the SubQuery team will be updating the Foundation [Sale Page](https://www.subquery.foundation/publicsale) with more details. We will publish a detailed sales guide with detailed instructions for participation. We will also be communicating with the community and partners regarding the whitelisting process. Stay tuned!
