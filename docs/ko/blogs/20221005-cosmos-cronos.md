# SubQuery Supports Ethermint via Integration with Cronos

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*fisvq1g9Z-XDgJED)

SubQuery is proud to announce it has extended its data indexing support within the Cosmos ecosystem with its latest partnership with Cronos, the blockchain supported by the Crypto.com exchange. As a result of the integration, SubQuery now supports the Ethermint blockchain unlocking further opportunities for web3 developers building on top of it.

After its rapid expansion into the Cosmos ecosystem with integrations with [Juno](./20220609-juno-cosmos.md), [Fetch.ai](./20220719-fetch.md), [Stargaze](./20220726-stargaze.md) and Cosmos Hub in the last few months, SubQuery received support from the Cronos Ecosystem Grants programme to develop the first indexing solution specifically for builders in Cronos.

[Cronos](https://cronos.org/) is the first EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK, supported by Crypto.com, Crypto.org, and more than 300+ app developers and partners. Cronos is building an open ecosystem where developers can create their own DeFi and GameFi applications, targeting a base of 50+ million users globally. Earlier this year, Cronos Labs launched a [$100M Accelerator](https://cronos.org/accelerators) program to help developers build new projects and the future of Web3 within the Cronos ecosystem.

Ken Timsit, Managing Director at Cronos Labs, shared "Cronos' goal of supporting Web3 developers to build the next generation of DeFi and GameFi applications can be accelerated now that SubQuery's flexible data indexing solution is available to our community. We are delighted that the Cronos Ecosystem Grants programme could be leveraged by SubQuery to enhance the Cronos chain as it becomes the foundational infrastructure for the open metaverse"

SubQuery provides decentralised data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains. As an open data indexer that is flexible and fast, the open indexing tool helps developers build APIs in hours and quickly index chains with the assistance of dictionaries (pre-computed indices).

Engineered for multi-chain applications, SubQuery's tools allow developers to organize, store, and query on-chain data for their protocols and applications. SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience.

Now, the open-source SubQuery software-development-kit (SDK) not only supports EVM, WASM and CosmWasm smart contracts, it fully supports the Ethermint EVM implementation, including custom application binary interfaces (ABI's) and smart contracts.

After establishing itself as the leading data indexing solution on Polkadot, by serving hundreds of millions of queries daily, SubQuery has expanded to serve other Layer-1 blockchains such as the [Cosmos](./20220909-cosmoshub.md) ecosystem alongside [Algorand](./20220713-algorand.md) and [Avalanche](./20220321-avalache.md).

[Sam Zou](https://twitter.com/zoujialiu), the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, commented, *"SubQuery's mission is to accelerate the Web3 revolution by providing tools that make developers' lives easier. We are excited to have such fantastic support from Cronos and look forward to provide their developers the ability to build complex dApps with the support of SubQuery's leading multi-chain indexing solution."*

With the successful completion of the Frontier testnet in July, SubQuery is now focused on launching the Kepler canary network before decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the SubQuery Network. The SubQuery Network will be simple and accessible to all, innovate in payment methods, and will support indexing Cosmos projects including Cronos from the outset.

## About Cronos

Cronos (cronos.org) is the first EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK, supported by Crypto.com, Crypto.org, and more than 300+ app developers and partners. Cronos is building an open ecosystem where developers can create their own DeFi and GameFi applications, targeting a base of 50+ million users globally. Earlier this year, Cronos Labs launched a $100M Accelerator program to help developers build new projects and the future of Web3 within the Cronos ecosystem.

When developers build on Cronos, they can leverage all Ethereum developer tools (i.e. Solidity, Truffle, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Web3.js, ethers.js, ChainSafe Gaming SDK); leading crypto wallets (i.e. MetaMask, Crypto.com Defi Wallet, Trust Wallet); wrapped versions of the world's top 50 cryptocurrencies; Cronos Play, a suite of developer tools for Unity, C++ and Unreal engine; and inter-blockchain communication (IBC) cross-chain connectivity to Cosmos chains; and as well as a rich ecosystem of composable DeFi and GameFi dApps.

## 서브쿼리란

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Cosmos and Algorand projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
