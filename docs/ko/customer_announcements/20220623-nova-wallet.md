![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ypE3GClFYjuqVwrM)

SubQuery is the Universal Web3 data indexing toolkit. SubQuery enables anyone to index, transform, and query blockchain data to power their applications. In this Customer Case Study series we'll hone in on how one team uses SubQuery to elevate and enhance their project via the seamless provision of mission critical data.

## Summary

Nova Wallet, a next generation mobile wallet application uses SubQuery to track the activity on every single Polkadot and Kusama parachain and found they could harness SubQuery's data capabilities to offer unique features over-and-above what they initially expected.

> *"One of the main goals of Nova Wallet is to provide a top-notch experience and a convenient UI for the users. This goal wouldn't be achieved without the help of SubQuery --- a premium solution for the data aggregation, indexing, and API provision for the apps in the ecosystem."* - Anton Khvorov, CEO of Nova Wallet & Nova Foundation

SubQuery enables Nova Wallet to bootstrap a datasource for any network that provides API for Operation history, Transfers based on balances/assets/ORML pallets, Staking analytics based on staking/parachainStaking pallets in less than 10 minutes

Nova Wallet credits SubQuery as instrumental for them to provide the below unique features to their users:
- Transfer history for any asset
- Staking rewards history
- Total staking rewards
- Other operations of user's account history (governance voting, swaps, staking management operations, etc)
- Plans to go beyond with cross-chain transfers in their next milestone

## The Challenge Facing Nova Wallet

Nova Wallet developed a new mobile app wallet for Polkadot and Kusama where users can manage all of their ecosystem tokens, enjoy a convenient staking experience, explore ecosystem DApps, and contribute to crowdloans with no limits. As a wallet focussed on supporting the entire Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem as quickly as possible, Nova naturally need to support each network as soon as they launch and enable asset transfers. At Nova's inception this would have been virtually impossible, but by partnering with SubQuery and it's unique architecture, only simple configuration changes are required to extend the standard Nova Wallet SubQuery project to each new network.

The birth of the Nova Wallet and SubQuery partnership occurred in mid-2021 when the Nova team were struggling to find find a convenient, customizable, and reliable way to fetch data which is not available from blockchain API directly, but crucial to be provided in a user-facing application like Nova Wallet to dramatically increase the UX. Nova found existing solutions at the time to be very limited and inflexible until they came across SubQuery and were able to quickly get their first SubQuery project up-and-running to aggregate and query their data of interest.

## How SubQuery Helped Nova Wallet

Nova Wallet depends on SubQuery to provide data for transactions, account history, and all different types of staking events and rewards for over 50 different Polkadot parachains and counting. Due to its fast and flexible nature, SubQuery is a core service that Nova have embraced to provide their users with an exceptional user experience. Additionally, SubQuery's advanced dictionary support on each parachain allows extremely rapid sync times and faster development iterations.

> *"SubQuery provides robust and reliable hosted service which has proven itself in production for thousands of Nova Wallet users. From our experience, SubQuery contributes ideally to the Nova Wallet goal to be the premium mobile application for Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem"* - Ruslan Rezin, CTO of Nova Wallet & Nova Foundation

## The Results

On Nova Wallet's mission to become the most trusted wallet within Polkadot, an open and universal tool like SubQuery was invaluable to allow them to accelerate alongside each new Kusama and Polkadot parachain rollout. Nova are a key user of SubQuery's intelligent routing which dynamically routes a user's request to the nearest SubQuery cluster resulting in higher reliability and superior performance than any other option on the market. With the help of SubQuery, Nova can bootstrap a datasource for any network that provides API for Operation history, Transfers based on balances/assets/ORML pallets, Staking analytics based on staking/parachainStaking pallets in less than 10 minutes

Nova Wallet are proud to boast the below unique features they can offer in their application, crediting SubQuery as the instrumental data tool which allows them to do so:

1.  Transfer history for any asset
2.  Staking rewards history
3.  Total staking rewards
4.  Other operations of user's account history (governance voting, swaps, staking management operations, etc)
5.  Plans to go beyond with cross-chain transfers in their next milestone

The Nova Wallet team is looking forward to continue our journey together with the SubQuery team in building the most advanced and high-quality mobile app for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem."* - Anton Khvorov, CEO of Nova Wallet & Nova Foundation
