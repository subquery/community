# Solarbeam work with SubQuery for their new Eclipse Launchpad

Today we want to announce our partnership between Solarbeam and SubQuery Network. Solarbeam is the [largest DEX](https://defillama.com/chain/Moonriver) on Moonriver’s Kusama-based parachain with a peak TVL of more than $180m. This requires reliable, high-speed data querying capabilities for their user interface.

Solarbeam recently launched [Eclipse](https://app.solarbeam.io/eclipse), a launchpad built for cross-chain token pools and auctions, enabling projects to raise capital on a decentralized and interoperable environment based on Moonriver.

> _“_SubQuery has proved to be a reliable tool for querying events and transactions on EVM and Substrate based chains, with a minimal latency for syncing new data and suitable for large amounts of data. As a result, we believe SubQuery will provide as good of an experience on Moonbeam as it has for us on Moonriver”. _— Founder, Solarbeam_

[SubQuery’s](https://subquery.network/) service helps drive analytics for the Eclipse IDO launchpad by Solarbeam. Ahead of their launch on Moonbeam, Solarbeam will be integrating SubQuery with their user portfolio analytics tool which will enable users to track their farming and profit history. This is made possible by the [recent integration of Moonbeam and Moonriver’s EVM with SubQuery](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-adds-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-functionality-in-integration-with-moonbeam-and-ddbcdf0fd8ff).

In the example below, we’re using SubQuery to easily retrieve the top two participations and pools in Solarbeam’s DEX ordered by total amounts. You can see how a simple GraphQL query can quickly get the data that Solarbeam need to build an intuitive user experience.

Solarbeam is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services we provide are completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).

## 서브쿼리란

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications (DApps). Currently focused on Polkadot and Substrate projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.
