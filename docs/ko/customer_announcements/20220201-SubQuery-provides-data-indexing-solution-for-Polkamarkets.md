# SubQuery provides data indexing solution for Polkamarkets

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*KRx5x-Oaz7mfHPuJ)

Today we are pleased to announce our partnership between Polkamarkets and SubQuery Network. Polkamarkets is a blockchain protocol that has combined DeFi and prediction markets where traders can leverage their knowledge of the past, present and future to forecast specific, real world outcomes . Polkamarkets is leveraging SubQuery’s data indexing expertise to augment the protocol’s data handling capabilities.

Querying and aggregating on-chain data is a complex and costly process. In order to build increasingly complex and intuitive applications, developers need powerful tools to process and query their data faster. While Polkamarkets Labs had previously built their own [indexing solution](https://github.com/Polkamarkets/polkamarkets-api) they elected to migrate to SubQuery to improve their scalability as their protocol gains more traction.

> “Prediction markets are only as reliable as the data they use. This partnership with SubQuery enables the Polkamarkets protocol to enhance its data handling capabilities to ensure a robust and smooth user experience, while adding powerful data tools for developers using the protocol to build their own prediction market apps. We look forward to seeing where our technologies can work together to bring greater prediction market usage and adoption.” — Ricardo Marques, Co-Founder of Polkamarkets.

As the leading data indexer in Polkadot, SubQuery will be used to index and aggregate Polkamarkets’ protocol, such as:

- Users’ portfolio/transaction history
- Market outcomes price history
- Market resolution POLK bonds history

> “One of the most exciting applications of blockchain is prediction markets and trading, we’re excited to partner with the leading player in this space in Polkadot. Creating a prediction market isn’t just about collecting real world events, it requires an excellent user interface to display this information and allow users to take the right positions — we’re keen to play a big part in this development.” — James Bayly, Head of Business Development at SubQuery.

The Polkamarkets protocol is being deployed in Kusama through Moonriver, and soon to Polkadot through Moonbeam. The indexing and query services managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community are available in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).
