Discord bots - we imagine them as cute little AI policemen of Discord. But what is starrybot exactly?

[Starrybot ](https://starrybot.xyz/)is a discord bot which enables the guild admin to create token-gated roles and channels with CW721, CW20 and native tokens.

Administrators of a Discord can add the bot and set up custom "token rules" that decide which rules to give their members based on what digital assets they hold.

Members of the guild can opt into the token gating by using the Slash Command "/starry join" to allow their [Keplr wallet ](https://www.keplr.app/)to verify which roles they should have.

Through authentication with Keplr wallet members can strengthen the membership of their Discord Communities.

So how does starrybot use SubQuery? Starrybot started using SubQuery by creating a visualisation of how communities are using starrybot.

This pie chart, powered by SubQuery's indexing and aggregation of on-chain data, highlights the token rules set up by a guild admin when installing starrybot.

This is a small use case, but starrybot knows that the possibilities with SubQuery are endless!

Starrybot receives feedback about the need to quickly add/remove roles based on NFTs changing ownership. This is exactly the type of thing a powerful indexer like SubQuery excels at, and starrybot sees this as the next leap forward.
