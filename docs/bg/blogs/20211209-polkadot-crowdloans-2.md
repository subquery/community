# Отвътре The Polkadot Crowdloans (Част 2)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*MqQhXJbmnfMSqf-8)

Polkadot предостави на общността си още едно вълнуващо състезание за третия им аукцион на парачейн слот. Наскоро станахме свидетели как Parallel Finance и Astar се борят за третия слот и в крайна сметка Astar успя да излезе победител. Днес ще проучим малко повече за случилото се в рамките на третия търг, като се потопим в данните зад всеки отделен принос.

SubQuery е водещата услуга за индексиране на данни на Polkadot и през последната седмица захранвахме милиони ежедневни заявки към по-голямата част от таблата за управление, приложенията за принос и уебсайтовете за анализ. Екипи като [SubVis](https://www.subvis.io/), [Parallel Finance](https://parallel.fi/), и [DotMarketCap](https://dotmarketcap.com/) разчитат на SubQuery, за да предоставят данни в реално време за груповите заеми и други данни във верига директно на своите уебсайтове и приложения.

Firstly, let’s start with some high level quick facts. As you can see below Astar had both more contributions and contributors. It’s important to note that Parallel raised a significant amount through its proxy fund, so the contributor amount is misleading because the proxy account hides this information.

Both received a median contribution of 10 DOT (US$367.70) but Astar was able to attract the largest single contribution with 2,005,295 DOT (US$73.7 million). In the end a total of almost 20 million DOT (US$735.4 million) was contributed across both two during the third auction. Unsurprisingly, this number was less than the amount committed in the first auctions, however it is promising to see the auction amounts still being of significant value.

Similarly to the [Moonbeam and Acala battle](./20211124-polkadot-crowdloans.md), this auction had significantly different styles of participation while maintaining a relatively equal amount of contributions. Parallel Finance had 20,000 less contributions to their crowdloan when compared to Astar.

But it’s not the number of contributions that matters here, rather the value of those contributions. As you can see in the chart below the auction was incredibly tight, with the lead passing between teams through the auction.

As you can see in the following graphs there were two events to watch, the first was a huge spike in contributions to Astar on the 12th of November. This gave them a steady lead until the 24th of November, where Parallel Finance gained almost 2.5 million DOT (US$91 million).

For the first event occurred on the 12th of November at 2:26am UTC when an account linked to Binance deposited in quick succession, 2,005,295 DOT (US$73.5 million) to Astar and 1,026,763 DOT (US$37.9 million) to Parallel Finance. This is likely Binance providing the contributions that it collects from it’s own community to each crowdloan.

The second even was a bit weirder, and was rather 25 separate events.In a 11 minutes, Parallel’s Crowdloan proxy vehicle made 25 identical contributions of 98,982 DOT (US$3,639,568.14) each to Parallel totalling 2,474,550 DOT (US$90,989,203.50). It’s not clear why these deposits were made via smaller DOT amounts, potentially Parallel’s Crowdloan proxy vehicle was set up to contribute a maximum amount of this value each time.

Astar and Parallel Finance led a very competitive auction, where Astar was selected as the winner at block [7927110](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/7927110), with a lead of only 120,000 DOT. If there was another random block selected any earlier or later, the result may have been quite different.

So who is contributing? Firstly there are two massive whales that are responsible for a combined 41% of all contributions and 69.34% of all value (13,756,262 DOT). These two accounts represent Parallel Finance’s Crowdloan proxy vehicle and Binance. Kraken and Bifrost’s SALP program were also represented in the top 6 contributors. Parallel’s Crowdloan proxy vehicle was particularly prevalent in our results with over 9.3 million DOT contributed (US$344.6 million) representing over 47% of all contributions.

Unfortunately this high percentage means that comparing the average contribution size is difficult, since this proxy obscures the contribution data way too much. In the future, we might even dive deep into Parallel’s data and use this to determine exactly how many of these contributions come from whales versus individual small cap investors.

Having two auctions that have been extremely competitive suggests a healthy ecosystem, and it is encouraging to see the amount of commitment that the community has shown. Here at SubQuery we are very excited to continue working alongside the best Polkadot projects, and can’t wait to see what the future has in store for us.
