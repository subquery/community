Today we are proud to reveal our long-term partnership with the team at Nova Wallet. 
Nova Wallet have developed a new mobile app wallet for Polkadot and Kusama where users can manage all of their ecosystem tokens, 
enjoy a convenient staking experience,
explore ecosystem DApps, and contribute to crowdloans with no limits.
Nova Wallet depend on SubQuery to provide data for transactions, account history, and all different types of staking
events and rewards for over 27 different Polkadot parachains and counting. SubQuery is a core service that Nova have
embraced to provide their users with an exceptional user 
experience.

As a wallet focussed on supporting the entire Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem as quickly as possible, Nova naturally 
need to support each network as soon as they launch and enable asset transfers. SubQuery’s unique architecture means that only simple 
configuration changes are required to extend the standard Nova Wallet SubQuery project to each new network. 
Additionally, SubQuery’s advanced dictionary support on each parachain allows extremely rapid sync times and faster development iterations.

>“Nova Wallet is a next-gen multi-chain and multi-asset mobile wallet for Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. 
One of the main goals of Nova Wallet is to provide a top-notch experience and a convenient UI for the users. 
This goal wouldn’t be achieved without the help of SubQuery — a premium solution for the data aggregation, 
indexing, and API provision for the apps in the ecosystem. We have been working with the SubQuery team for almost a year now, 
and Nova Wallet has taken advantage of SubQuery infrastructure across many features, such as operations history for the Polkadot
and parachain assets, staking data & analytics. 
Nova Wallet team is looking forward to continue our journey together with the SubQuery team in building the most advanced and high-quality mobile app 
for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.”
