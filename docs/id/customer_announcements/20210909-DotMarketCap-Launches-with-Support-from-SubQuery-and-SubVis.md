Last week, [DotMarketCap.com](https://dotmarketcap.com/) launched just ahead of the second batch of Kusama Parachain Auctions to provide data, blogs, prices, and other content on the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.

A huge amount of this live, real time data comes from SubQuery, specifically from the existing project maintained by [SubVis](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/subvis-io/kusama-auction). This is an excellent example of how [SubQuery's Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) and open source approach facilitates collaboration and teamwork in the Polkadot ecosystem

> *"SubQuery, with over 60 projects and millions of query requests per day, as well as data from Subvis, is the perfect place to support and provide DotMarketCap with the fastest and most accurate access to Crowdloan & Auction data. With that reliable data source and DMC's signature UI UX, we believe this partnership will bring great experience and easy access to the Polkadot community."* - Sang Tran (Founder DotMarketCap)

Kusama parachain auction is the most important event this year, and with [Auction & Crowdloan tracking](https://dotmarketcap.com/auction), you can stay up to date of the fierce competition between projects, as well as support your favourite candidates to win a parachain slot via their crowdloan.

For SubQuery, this is a realisation of our goal to build an open community marketplace of data in our Explorer. This is the best example so far of a huge customer consuming data from a SubQuery project built and maintained by another team. It shows how symbiotic the Polkadot ecosystem is, and how teams work together to achieved a shared goal of a decentralised future

> *"For sure DotMarketCap 2.0 couldn’t be completed without the support of our partners: SubQuery and [Subvis.io](http://subvis.io/). All the data we used for our auction & crowdloan page was taken from [Subvis.io](http://subvis.io/). Thanks to this cooperation, things are much easier for us to get access to decentralised data. We would like to express our gratitude to Sam Zou, James Bayly and the entire SubQuery team."* - DotMarketCap
