During the week of July 5th, Ternoa has introduced its new Wallet, an app allowing future users to send and receive $CAPS and ‘**_Secret NFTs’_** minted on the Ternoa Blockchain, as well as easily unveiling their Secret to their owners. The concept of ‘**_Secret_**’ for ‘**_NTFs_**’ has been imagined by the Ternoa team.

Those ‘_secret NFTs_’ can be found and purchased in the dedicated marketplace ([https://www.secret-nft.com/](https://www.secret-nft.com/)) built by the Ternoa Team. The Ternoa Wallet is a solution inspired by the [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) project, allowing users to easily login and purchase NFTs with a simple QR code interaction between the website and the app.

**_Secret NFTs_** are a special kind of NFTs invented and developed by Ternoa, and made possible by their unique and elegant blockchain architecture: Secret-NFTs are composed of two medias, one public with watermark or a lower quality, and the other private that can only be seen by the owner of said NFT. This offers an amazing protection from forgery for artists and KOLs, and opens up a lot of use cases.

> “We made the choice to use SubQuery because the documentation seemed clear to us at first glance and we were not mistaken. SubQuery provides a complete environment with a docker machine which makes testing and deployment very easy. It is relatively easy to develop in this environment and to program the listening of the different events emitted by our blockchain. Congratulations also to the support which is very responsive.” — Ternoa CTO

Layanan [SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) juga membantu mengekstrak dan mengkueri data on chain untuk Secret-NFT yang dimint di Ternoa Blockchain, dengan cara yang mendukung fitur unik NFT Ternoa.
