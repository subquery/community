[The release of the Project Insights page](../blogs/20221004-project-insights.md) has been highly anticipated by our customers and has elevated the Managed Service to be more than just infrastructure hosting, it's now a complete service. Within one platform, you can reliably publish your latest creation, scale your app to thousands (if not millions) of users, and now view detailed analytics and insights on how your SubQuery Project is operating.

With the new Insights page customers can see how their projects have been performing with in depth detail on request count and data egress over any time period. This is just the beginning, and we're interested to hear what you think we should add next to our Project Insights.

Now our customers can dig deeper into the performance of their SubQuery projects and rest easy relying on our premium hosting solution.
