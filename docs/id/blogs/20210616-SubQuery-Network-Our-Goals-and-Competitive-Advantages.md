# SubQuery Network - Tujuan dan Keunggulan Kompetitif Kami

Hari ini kita akan menjelajah tujuan yang kita miliki dengan SubQuery dan beberapa keunggulan kompetitif yang menurut kami membuat Jaringan SubQuery lebih baik daripada pesaing kami.

SubQuery’s currently provided indexing and transformation data in a centralised way. Although this has allowed us to power some of the top Polkadot projects; DeFi apps like Acala and Bifrost, wallets like Fearless Wallet, NFT platforms like [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/), cross-chain bridges like [Darwinia](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/darwinia), and analytics platforms like [SubVis](https://subvis.io/) — it has it’s downside.

It requires our users to trust the service we provide, and carries risks associated with a centralised service, like potential server failures or outages that can cripple your applications. This is a major reason why we are moving to a decentralised future.

Keunggulan Kompetitif kami

We understand that The SubQuery Network is competing against many players in the decentralised data industry, SubQuery looks to provide unique benefits through a multitude of competitive advantages. Our guiding principles, and what we expect to be the main advantages, are the simplicity and flexibility of our network.

## Fleksibilitas

Our first advantage is our flexibility. SubQuery is open source, so anyone has the freedom to define the data set that is specific to their needs, tailored to their applications. Rather than having to combine queries from different API endpoints — you can define the shape of your APIs yourself. It saves time, money, and provides a vastly better experience for your users.

## Kesederhanaan

You do not need to be an expert to take advantage of what SubQuery offers. There is literally 3 files that need to be changed to make a working SubQuery project. Our focus will be on making SubQuery easier to use and build with than our competitors — SubQuery’s success depends on the success of our community building the future with it.

## Ketidakseimbangan Indexer/Delegator

Among our competitors, we believe the ability for Indexers to change delegation reward rates without warning is unfair. We try to fix this by requiring Indexers to advertise a decrease to the Query Fee Revenue Share Rate for an entire staking era (28 day period).

## Order Pembelian daripada Kurator

In marketplaces like SubQuery, where there are both buyers and sellers of data, signalling demand for future supply is difficult. Other competitors use “curators” to achieve this, participants who predict future demand and are rewarded when that future demand eventuates.

SubQuery has taken a different approach in where we look to Consumers to create an upfront commitment, a purchase order. This can be used both to attract Indexers to new SubQuery Projects, or to attract additional Indexers to existing and uncompetitive SubQuery Projects.

## Insentif untuk Kinerja Kueri:

Proses discovery dan routing Pengindeks kami akan mencakup data kinerja (latensi dan waktu aktif) untuk semua Pengindeks, dan kami akan mengambil langkah-langkah untuk memastikan bahwa Konsumen melaporkan data ini saat membuka pembayaran mikro ke Pengindeks.

Ini idealnya akan mendorong Pengindeks di Jaringan SubQuery untuk menyediakan infrastruktur dengan waktu aktif tinggi dan latensi rendah, kinerja terbaik.

## Fokus pada Substrate/Polkadot:

SubQuery committed to focus on Polkadot and Substate from the day we started. This allowed our service and tools to be built from the outset to work with Substrate. On top of this, Polkadots unique architecture makes it easier for SubQuery to support multiple current and future blockchains automatically.
