# SubQuery Extends Cosmos Zone Indexing with THORChain Integration

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*DZk2eFd5DjfVsmFX)

SubQuery's goal has always been to provide fast and efficient indexing to the widest variety of chains possible. Today we're proud to announce we've started supporting another [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) chain: [THORChain](https://thorchain.org/), a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol that allows users to swap assets between blockchain networks.

THORChain provides a solution in the form of a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on the Cosmos software development kit (SDK). Its automated market maker (AMM)-based protocol provides the backend technology needed to swap cryptocurrencies between blockchains that were previously non-interoperable.

One of the most significant innovations to come out of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is the automated market maker (AMM) model. AMMs allow crypto users to deposit a specific ratio of cryptocurrencies to a so-called liquidity pool. Participants then use these pooled funds to execute trades, with the pooled cryptocurrencies acting as the trading pair.

> _"As THORChain is integrated into more wallets, DEXes, and platforms it will become more important than ever to gain visibility into network data, and SubQuery's advanced indexer will help community developers do exactly that. With SubQuery, developers can now index any THORChain event (Swaps, Savers Deposits, Affiliate fees), react to those events, and build advanced queries into the data that were not previously possible. SubQuery will empower the next phase of data visibility for THORChain, and we can't wait to see what community devs build."_ - Eridanus, Senior Engineer at Nine Realms

THORChain will benefit from the full SubQuery experience, including the open-source SDK, tools, [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos.html), developer support, and other benefits developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem including [SubQuery's managed service](https://subquery.network/managedservices), which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles over 400 million requests each day.

> Sam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, said _"SubQuery is the leading indexer in the Cosmos ecosystem and we are proud to extending our support to THORChain built on the Cosmos SDK. Our fast and flexible indexer is designed to save developers time and money, letting them focus on building their dApp, rather than on running infrastructure. We're excited to see which amazing DeFi applications THORChain devs will build with the power of SubQuery's universal data indexing toolkit."_

SubQuery provides decentralised data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains. As an open data indexer that is flexible and fast, the open indexing tool helps developers build APIs in hours and quickly index chains with the assistance of dictionaries (pre-computed indices).

Engineered for multi-chain applications, SubQuery's tools allow developers to organize, store, and query on-chain data for their protocols and applications. SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience.

Now, the open-source SubQuery software-development-kit (SDK) not only supports EVM, WASM and CosmWasm smart contracts, it fully supports the Ethermint EVM implementation, including custom application binary interfaces (ABI's) and smart contracts.

After establishing itself as the leading data indexing solution on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), by serving hundreds of millions of queries daily, SubQuery has expanded to serve other Layer-1 blockchains such as the [Cosmos](./20220909-cosmoshub.md) ecosystem alongside [Algorand](./20220713-algorand.md), [Flare ](./20221202-flare.md)and [Avalanche](./20220321-avalache.md).

## Tentang SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, Cosmos and Flare projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
