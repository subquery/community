# SubQuery Announces Integration with Osmosis

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6XnCgzPFE0TjLQLk)

SubQuery is proud to announce it has extended its data indexing support to Osmosis Zone, a leading DeFi platform in the Cosmos ecosystem!

After recent integrations with [CosmosHub,](./20220909-cosmoshub.md) [Juno](./20220609-juno-cosmos.md), [Fetch.ai](./20220719-fetch.md), [Stargaze](./20220726-stargaze.md) and [Cronos](./20221005-cosmos-cronos.md), Osmosis is the latest Cosmos zone to receive indexing support from SubQuery. From now on, Osmosis' growing developer community can leverage SubQuery's leading edge indexing tool for their web3 projects.

[Osmosis Zone](https://osmosis.zone/) is an open-source DeFi platform based on Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) technology developed for the Cosmos Network. Osmosis is an automated market maker (AMM) built with the Cosmos SDK; it specializes in the InterchainDeFi movement (Tendermint-based blockchains) in the Cosmos ecosystem.

> _"Indexing web3 data is not easy, especially when it comes to data scaling. SubQuery's API building tools make it easy to get up and running with custom APIs for decentralized applications. I'm very excited to have SubQuery's support for Osmosis."_ - Daniel Farina, Developer Relations at Osmosis

SubQuery provides decentralised data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains including Polkadot, [Avalanche](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20220321-avalache.html), [Algorand](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-algorand-support-developer-deep-dive-75771b016414) and [Cosmos](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-announces-integration-with-cosmos-hub-3cee6d3da6fe).

Engineered for multi-chain, SubQuery's open and flexible design allows developers to organize, store, and query on-chain data at speed for their protocols and applications. SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience with SDK support for EVM, WASM and CosmWasm smart contracts

> _"SubQuery is a fast, flexible and universal blockchain indexing toolkit that makes developers' lives easier. We're proud to be supporting Osmosis and excited to see how developers building on Osmosis are going to use SubQuery to power up their dApps."_ - Marta Adamczyk, Technology Evangelist at SubQuery

Osmosis will benefit from the full SubQuery experience, including the open-source SDK, tools, [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos.html), developer support, and other benefits developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem.

Additionally, Osmosis is accommodated by [SubQuery's managed service](https://subquery.network/managedservices), which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles over 400 million requests each day.

SubQuery is now focused on launching the Kepler canary network before decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the [SubQuery Network.](https://subquery.network/network) The SubQuery Network will be simple and accessible to all, innovative in payment methods, and will support indexing Cosmos projects including Osmosis from the outset.

## Tentang SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
