# SubQuery’s New Spartan Programme

In August, [SubQuery launched its Ambassador programme](./20210713-Introducing-the-SubQuery-Ambassador-Program.md) to find community leaders passionate about Polkadot and SubQuery. Our goal was to find self-starters that could spread the word about SubQuery in their local areas and provide support to new developers building amazing apps and services on Polkadot.

We did not expect what happened next!

In the last few months we have been completely overwhelmed by thousands and thousands of applications, and our initial plans to manually onboard applicants has become challenging. We know that there are many applicants who have not heard back from us and it has become clear that we need to do a better job and provide a way that our community can work with us.

After consultation with our existing Ambassadors we have designed a new, and transparent method to level up in [our Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/subquery) and potentially become an Ambassador.

Today, we are pleased to announce the creation of the SubQuery Spartan Programme. The Spartan Programme exists entirely within our Discord community, where aspiring Ambassadors can complete monthly tasks and competitions in order to earn the Spartan tag. The Spartans who then rise to the top of their class will be recommended by the existing Ambassadors to the SubQuery team to join their ranks.

In addition to the potential of becoming an Ambassador, Discord members with the Spartan role will be afforded special perks and rights within the SubQuery community.

To find out more about our Spartan programme and participate in our November competition please [join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/subquery).

## Tentang SubQuery

SubQuery is a data aggregation layer that operates between the layer-1 blockchains (such as Moonriver and Polkadot) and DApps. This service unlocks blockchain data and transforms it to a queryable state so that it can be used in intuitive applications. It allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.
