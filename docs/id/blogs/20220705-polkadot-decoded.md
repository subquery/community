It's been a *crazy* week for the SubQuery team as we prepare for the [SubQuery Token Public Sale](https://www.subquery.foundation/publicsale) coming up in July! Amidst back to back calls and interviews with our community, partners and investors, [James](https://twitter.com/JamesABayly), Head of BD and [Siqi](https://twitter.com/SIQI_JIA7), our Global Community Manager (China), head to Berlin and Hangzhou (China) to attend [The Biggest Polkadot Event of the Year](https://decoded.polkadot.network/)!

James and Siqi aim to bring a life-changing solution to all Web3 developers helping to define the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) ecosystem. [Polkadot Decoded](https://decoded.polkadot.network/) *here we come!*

First up in Berlin, James gave an amazing workshop on *'Building dApps on Polkadot's EVM Solutions'*, demonstrating how [SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) as a blockchain developer toolkit enables developers to build Web3 applications of the future, much faster and more productively.

He explained that this speed and increased efficiency is made possible as a SubQuery project acts as a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains (such as [_Polkadot_](https://polkadot.network/)_, _[_Substrate_](https://substrate.io/)*, _[_Avalanche_](https://www.avax.network/)* and _[_Terra_](https://www.terra.money/) projects). This data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.

With [Bill Laboon](https://twitter.com/BillLaboon) from [Web3 Foundation](https://twitter.com/Web3foundation) and [Oscar](https://twitter.com/OscarFranklnTan) from [Efinity](https://twitter.com/efinityio)

Finally, James unveiled that the upcoming SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way. Developers can look forward to participating in the SubQuery Network by joining the much-anticipated [token sale](https://www.subquery.foundation/publicsale)!

Next up in Hangzhou, Siqi gave a Lightning Pitch on *'How to Make Data Indexing Easier in the Age of Multiple Chains'*, addressing the biggest pain point in data acquisition for developers creating new blockchain projects.

Siqi shared how SubQuery provides an instant solution for developers to index and query data easily, so that they can access on-chain data quickly, allowing them to channel their energy and resources into their use case and building powerful UIs for their front end.

We had an *amazing* time with the Polkadot community and look forward to being back next year for [Polkadot Decoded](https://decoded.polkadot.network/) 2023!

## Tentang SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is the Universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
