# SubQuery Becomes the First Indexing Solution for an Avalanche Subnet

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*xeOtjs47hvMxlMas)

At SubQuery, we've always had the goal of being the most unified indexer out there. Regardless of whatever chain you are building your dApp on, we hope to be able to index it.

Today we are pleased to announce that SubQuery is the first indexing solution to be connected and indexing a custom Avalanche Subnet! This was made possible by the team at [Heroes of NFT](https://heroesofnft.com/), an [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/)-native project that has three main pillars: NFTs, Games and the Metaverse.

Subnets are the next generation of Avalanche's growth, and are similar to Polkadot's parachains or Cosmos' Zones whereby they empower developers to build custom blockchains optimised for specific use-cases while benefiting from interoperability from the main chain. Subnets represent a sovereign network built on Avalanche's foundations. Subnets are independent, they specify their own execution logic, determine their own fee regime, maintain their own state, facilitate their own networking, and provide their own security.

Heroes of NFT are one of the first teams to build on Avalanche Subnet and are using SubQuery to index idle game campaign creation data, with a key focus on finish and reinforcement events. In addition, they index all Auction events and all cards in their game including offers, asks, and bids. They leverage this data to ease both the user interface and experience in their web frontend. Heroes of NFT credits SubQuery's websocket services for making their user interface more smooth and dynamic.

The project is an excellent example of a complex and robust SubQuery project that leverages a few advanced features to provide scalable indexing. It connects to a subnet via a private endpoint, imports a number of different ABIs, and then has a number of efficient log handlers to ensure speedy indexing.

> _"Avalanche Subnets are key for the mass adoption of GameFi projects and our partnership with SubQuery will help us to maximize the benefits."_ - Memur, CEO at Heroes of NFT

SubQuery is a fast, flexible and universal blockchain indexing toolkit that helps developers in Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, and Cosmos focus on their core product, rather than waste time and money building their own indexing solution.

> _"SubQuery provides off-the-shelf support with minimal effort for developers working on any Avalanche Subnet. We're delighted that Heroes of NFT is using our fast & reliable indexing solution for their NFT, gaming & Metaverse project."_ - Marta Adamczyk, Technology Evangelist at SubQuery

Heroes of NFT also use [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. They take advantage of SubQuery's [enterprise-level hosting](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20211228-enterprise-hosted.html) to receive dedicated databases, automated deployments, and geographic routing to multiple clusters around the world for performance and uptime.

## About Heroes of NFT

Heroes of NFT is a native Avalanche project that has three main pillars: NFTs, Games (idle game and collectable card game) and the Metaverse. Idle games and collectable card games will feature play-to-earn mechanics while the NFTs are the main tools to play both games. In the Heroes of NFT Metaverse, players can create their own places, roam the universe, and interact with other users while enjoying the play-to-earn games in our battle arenas. The Metaverse will be the infrastructure for the game developers to launch their games with play to earn feature.

## Tentang SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
