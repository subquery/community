![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*LdQoekBCsctSL0Po)

Today we are excited to announce the continuation of our partnership with Gitcoin to run a second hackathon via Gitcoin Grants Round 13 starting on March 9th.

SubQuery's mission of making the world's decentralised data more accessible relies on having a network of developers who are empowered to create and innovate. After running our first Gitcoin Hackathon in December 2021 and achieving fantastic results with many talented developers it was an easy decision to extend our partnership.

The [Gitcoin GR13 Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr13/onboard) takes place from March 9th --- 24th 2022 with leading blockchain projects contributing to various prize pools. [SubQuery has proposed four bounties with a total prize pool of up to $22,000](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr13/?org=subquery). The prizes will be granted to those who have successfully completed the projects to the pre-set standards, and who deliver the most creative ideas, or those or solve areas to improve the core SubQuery SDK. A short summary of the challenges are below:

- Build a solution that stores a historical state of the blockchain rather than just the final state
- Create an alternative Substrate-like chain dictionary generation via a Substrate archive
- Enable SubQuery to support GraphQL subscriptions
- Build a staking dashboard in conjunction with Moonbeam Network

[Sam Zou](https://twitter.com/zoujialiu), the CEO and Founder of SubQuery commented, _"SubQuery is proud to partner with the Gitcoin GR13 Hackathon to build the future of Web3. It is in our interest to support motivated developers around the world to build on top of our data indexing service which is why we also recently launched a $500,000 SubQuery Grants Programme. We have developed bounties that should excite graduates of our 'Hero Course' and developers who are new to SubQuery and look forward to seeing the results"_

As part of the GR 13 Hackathon, SubQuery will be running workshops to help familiarise developers with our platform. In the meantime, you can [learn how to build applications in about SubQuery via the SubQuery Academy](https://subquery.coassemble.com/unlock/dOKZW6O#/). If you are interested in participating, you can sign-up to the kickoff event and [join the onboarding page here](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr13/onboard).
