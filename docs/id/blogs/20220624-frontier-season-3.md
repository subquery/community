On Tuesday 28 June, SubQuery will begin the final phase of the testing for the SubQuery Network with the launch of season 3 of the SubQuery Frontier testnet.

This period from 28th June to 15th July will mark the final phase of battle-testing before the SQT token sale and the official launch of the SubQuery Network.

Season 3 of the SubQuery Frontier testnet has the following goals. Firstly we are production testing the SubQuery smart contracts on Acala's Network and their EVM+ solution. Secondly, we plan to onboard thousands of participants and these numbers will push our process, documentation, and indexer applications to the limit. Finally, as part of our promise to be an open and inclusive network, it's everyone's chance to try out SubQuery publicly before the mainnet launches.

SubQuery is the leading multichain indexer, we build a universal tool that works across Polkadot, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos. From the outset, the SubQuery Network will support project from all networks that our SDK supports. When you join season 3, you will see this in action, with projects from Polkadot next to those from Juno (Cosmos).

In seasons 1 and 2 we had challenges for participants to complete, season 3 will be no different. In season 3 all participants (indexers, delegators, and consumers) will have the chance to complete challenges set out in the Frontier testnet and earn points. The top point scorers at the end of the testnet will be whitelisted for our public sale, and might even be invited to be Genesis Indexers on the SubQuery Network when it launches!

We are also releasing a few new features to our Network app which you can see for yourself at [frontier.subquery.network](https://frontier.subquery.network/). This is the new version of the UI that will make it easy and intuitive for consumers to find and select plans, as well as delegators to decide who to delegate their SQT to.

In summary, the public season 3 will give us the final answers to any questions ahead of our token generation event (TGE) and the launch of the SubQuery Network on Acala's parachain. Things are starting to move very fast for SubQuery

## About SubQuery Network

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
