# SubQuery Joins Berkeley's Blockchain Xcelerator

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*gYUy-1COtbpLV1X1)


This week we’re excited to announce that Berkeley has selected SubQuery to be part of their exclusive [Blockchain Xcelerator](https://www.xcelerator.berkeley.edu/). SubQuery (and it’s parent company OnFinality) were selected from over 200 applications to be part of just 21 exclusive spots.

Berkeley’s blockchain Xcelerator is known around the world as one of the most successful blockchain accelerators for a reason. It has incubated over 40 companies that have raised over $25M in seed and early stage funding, and over 75% of the inaugural batch raised follow-on funding. Additionally UC Berkeley remains a key hub for technology and innovation right next door to Silicon Valley. It’s certainly one of the leading university-based, non-dilutive blockchain accelerators worldwide — we’re thrilled to be a part of it!

> _“The team is over the moon to find out that we’re part of this awesome program! We’re looking forward to accelerating the development of SubQuery decentralized web data products. We’re ready to connect with some of the most influential projects and investors in Blockchain and to learn about how we can improve SubQuery”_ — Sam Zou (CEO and Founder of SubQuery and OnFinality).

We’re following in the footsteps of [Acala Network](https://acala.network/) (who we joined forces with last week to [launch the first SubQuery partner project](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-integrates-acala-to-aggregate-and-serve-defi-data-to-polkadot-and-kusama-builders-fc9af6a7aae1)) and other industry leaders like [StormX](https://stormx.io/) and [Eluv.io](https://eluv.io/). There is huge value to SubQuery and OnFinality in the network of highly regarded mentors, speakers, and fellows that the Xcelerator provides. As a data service provider (SubQuery) and an infrastructure service provider (OnFinality), long term partnerships and relationships with our customers is key to our success.

[SubQuery](https://www.subquery.network/) allows every Substrate/Polkadot team to process and query their data. The project is inspired by the growth of data protocols serving the application layer and its aim is to help Polkadot/Substrate projects build better dApps by allowing anyone to reliably find and consume data faster. Today, anyone can query and extract Polkadot network data in only minutes and at no cost.
