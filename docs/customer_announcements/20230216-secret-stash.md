![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*EbnAefxpU2bWbfam)

We're happy to announce our partnership with [Secret Stash](https://secret-stash.io/), Secret Stash is the first digital marketplace for [Ternoa](https://www.ternoa.network/) assets. Ternoa is the first NFT-centric blockchain.

Secret Stash are using SubQuery to efficiently retrieve on-chain data for the NFTs featured in their marketplace. This makes it incredibly convenient for them to manage various features such as Secret NFTs, auctions, and rental contracts; all of which are based on subql entities.

One of the major challenges Secret Stash faced before using SubQuery was the difficulty in fetching and parsing on-chain data. The scattered nature of data storage on the blockchain often led to a frustrating experience for developers. SubQuery has solved this problem for Secret Stash by providing a user-friendly development tool for extracting, querying, sorting and filtering relevant on-chain data for NFTs and account balance history.

"SubQuery offers exceptional tools for dApp developers, including a fast and easy project setup with the subql CLI and Docker containers facilitating launching operations. We at Secret Stash have tested the limits of subql with intricate nested entities, and it consistently performs admirably. The documentation is comprehensive and the support from the SubQuery team is outstanding. Excellent work!" --- Igor Papandinas, Co Founder & CTO at Secret Stash
