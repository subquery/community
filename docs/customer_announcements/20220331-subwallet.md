SubQuery is delighted to announce an integration partnership with [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/), a new multi-chain wallet for the Dotsama ecosystem. SubWallet makes it easy to track, send, receive and sign transactions on DeFi and GameFi applications and supports over 40 different parachains in the Dotsama network.

> _"With the mission of pulling crypto users closer to the Dotsama ecosystem and opening the Web3 universe, we are working with SubQuery to integrate their remarkable data indexing solution, so that SubWallet users can review transaction history and crowdloan information for over 40 different Polkadot parachains right in our extension wallet."_ - Hieu Dao, SubWallet Co-Founder

The Dotsama ecosystem consists of dozens of blockchains and thousands of Dapps containing a huge amount of extremely fragmented data. Subwallet has been able to leverage the hundreds of open projects available in [SubQuery's Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/), allowing them to integrate each new network faster and seamlessly. In short, SubQuery helps SubWallet provide more complete support for the Dotsama ecosystem and develop their applications faster.

> _"SubQuery is proud to power the data required for SubWallet to realise their vision of bringing an inviting and intuitive experience to their users. By partnering with innovative and fast-paced teams such as SubWallet we can remain agile and roll-out enhancements to ensure our mutual success"._ - Brittany Seales, Customer Success Lead at SubQuery

SubWallet is using [SubQuery Projects](https://managedservice.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. They take advantage of SubQuery's [enterprise-level hosting](../blogs/20211228-enterprise-hosted.md) to receive dedicated databases, automated deployments, and geographic routing to multiple clusters around the world for performance and uptime.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot and Substrate projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
