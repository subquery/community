# New Partnership: Heroes of NFT Super-charge Their dApps with SubQuery

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*pmo7QX8ZB__hoFdO)

We're thrilled to announce our partnership with [Heroes of NFT](https://heroesofnft.com/), an Avalanche-native project that has three main pillars: NFTs, Games and the Metaverse. We're proud to be helping them build a dynamic, smooth user interface and dApps with faster response times!

Heroes of NFT are using SubQuery to index idle game campaign creation data, with a key focus on finish and reinforcement events. They leverage this data to ease both the user interface and experience in their web frontend. Heroes of NFT credit SubQuery's websocket services for making their user interface more smooth and dynamic.

> _"Data indexers are extremely important to create dApps with faster response times. Thanks to SubQuery solutions, we can respond to any user input with our user interface very quickly on our subnet. For a scalable solution, this was a crucial step!"_ - Memur, CEO at Heroes of NFT

The team at Heroes of NFT are building a subnet to create their own metaverse ecosystem and to separate their application specific transactions from the Avalanche mainnet. As a result of this separation from the Avalanche mainnet traffic, their users can benefit from faster transactions and shorter wait times. SubQuery offers custom tailored indexing for Avalanche subnets meaning they don't have to manage their own large infrastructure to index the public transactions.

> _"As we have been evaluating different on-chain data indexers, we have come to the conclusion that Subquery can provide us with the best solution for subnet transaction indexing which will increase the UI/UX performance for the dapps. Hero Subnet will have greater strength than previously with this partnership."_ - Memur, CEO at Heroes of NFT

> _"We love to see the fast and flexible nature of SubQuery being used across different use cases in Web3. Heroes of NFT are driving the development of NFTs and Web3 games, and we can't wait to bolster their growth."_ - \*Brittany Seales, Customer Success Lead at SubQuery

Heroes of NFT are using [SubQuery Projects](https://managedservice.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. They take advantage of SubQuery's [enterprise-level hosting](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20211228-enterprise-hosted.html) to receive dedicated databases, automated deployments, and geographic routing to multiple clusters around the world for performance and uptime.

## About Heroes of NFT

Heroes of NFT is a native Avalanche project that has three main pillars: NFTs, Games (idle game and collectable card game) and the Metaverse. Idle games and collectable card games will feature play-to-earn mechanics while the NFTs are the main tools to play both games. In the Heroes of NFT Metaverse, players can create their own places, roam the universe, and interact with other users while enjoying the play-to-earn games in our battle arenas. The Metaverse will be the infrastructure for the game developers to launch their games with play to earn feature.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
