# SORA Integrates SubQuery to Provide Data to the SORA Network

![sora-header.jpg](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*fPPW0DsynIt9QpvK4ZrsUA.jpeg)

Today we are pleased to announce an exciting new project on SubQuery — SORA and Polkaswap. [SORA](https://sora.org/) has built a SubQuery Project that retrieves data from the SORA network to power mobile applications built on SORA and [Polkaswap.io](http://polkaswap.io/). You can try it out [here](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/sora-xor/sora).

> "SubQuery was selected to improve the UX of SORA network usage. We used SubQuery to get and list extrinsic details, calculate fiat prices and liquidity pool APY. Our goal was to get transaction history and aggregated data for applications that work with the SORA network.
>
> SubQuery has been the ideal solution for our needs because the application is easy to deploy and manage, it is easy to learn and develop as well as being well documented, and it also has its own infrastructure with Github integration. SubQuery's plain data structuring provides fast access, it supports GraphQL API for client applications, it has a flexible configuration for parsing events, extrinsics, and blocks with additional filtration. Finally, the application is completely transparent for users, so they won't notice if the application was updated or stopped."—SORA Development Team

Polkaswap is a leading DEX in the thriving Polkadot ecosystem and uses SubQuery to retrieve transfers, swaps that happen in Polkaswap, the addition or removal of liquidity, the flat price of tokens, and the APY for liquidity pools. 

SubQuery already makes developing the SORA mobile app and Polkaswap easier by reducing the time the team spends on building custom backend solutions and the team at SORA plan to expand their Polkaswap SubQuery Project to better support Polkaswap in the future.

In this example, we’re using SubQuery to pull the total amount of XOR that is held in each liquidity pool (filtered to show only the first 2 pools). This example also shows the current APY associated to each liquidity pool (filtered to show only the first 2 pools).

SORA is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services we provide are completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).

### About SORA

SORA is creating a supranational world economic system with built-in tools for decentralized finance (DeFi) under the cryptographic sortition-based democratic supervision of the SORA Parliament. 

The SORA network excels at providing tools for decentralized applications that use digital assets, such as atomic token swaps, bridging tokens to other blockchains, and creating programmatic rules involving digital assets.

### About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications (DApps). Currently focused on Polkadot and Substrate projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.
