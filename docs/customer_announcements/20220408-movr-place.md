# SubQuery Empowers MOVR Place to Make a Difference

SubQuery is extremely proud to be the data provider powering [MOVR Place](https://movr.place/), the first blockchain-based collaborative art canvas made for charity. The project was inspired by [Reddit's r/Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/), a 'subreddit' (a subsidiary thread within the Reddit platform) that functions as an open canvas, where each user can post a single, tiny, colored pixel every five minutes. Over _6 million_ Reddit users have banded together to collectively generate this massive, collaborative piece of artwork that has become a viral phenomenon.

The team behind [Neon Crisis](https://neoncrisis.io/) saw this success and the potential to elevate the concept with both blockchain technology and charity donations, and thus, MOVR Place was born. This canvas, built using data saved to Moonriver, is Polkadot's answer to r/Place.

MOVR Place utilises SubQuery to quickly render data on the front-end, compared to querying the EVM data on-chain directly. The MOVR Place team index the pixel data in the following three ways:

1. For the frontend: SubQuery stores pixel information in "buckets" that get queried and rendered on the MOVR Place app
2. For the leaderboard: SubQuery provides aggregated information on total pixels donated by each community and aggregated total pixels donated to each charity
3. For tracking individual participants: Storing account addresses as well as total pixels contributed

> _"I don't think MOVR Place would have been possible without SubQuery. As with any other new tech, there's always a steep learning curve at the start. But once you learn it, especially with the amount of resources and support that SubQuery provides, it gets easier."_ - Kenji, Core Developer & Lead at MOVR Place

MOVR Place was built to create a fun and positive way to make a difference. Upon making a contribution to the canvas the user can choose from a selection of charities which range from Humanitarian and Military aid for the Ukraine crisis to the Global Fund for Children. Each pixel costs USD$0.05 worth of MOVR at the time the project launched and 100% of the proceeds go to the chosen charities.

> _"The use cases for SubQuery are broad and far-reaching and we couldn't be more proud to support a project such as MOVR Place. This is one of the best examples of how blockchain technology can be applied to create something fun, while also proving the capability of a community coming together to create immense impact. It is very encouraging to see a project like this which harnesses the power of web3 to drive positive influence on the world."_ - Brittany Seales, Customer Success Lead at SubQuery

You can find more information about MOVR Place and the data they leverage from SubQuery via their project link https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/kenjicncr/movr-place-2022. The project can also be found by searching 'MOVR' in the [SubQuery Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) which is a project library managed completely by SubQuery for the Polkadot Community.

The canvas will only remain open for 2 weeks, after which the contract will remain locked forever. You can learn more about how to leave your mark on the canvas and select your charity here: ​​https://movr.place/

## About SubQuery

SubQuery is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate and Avalanche projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
