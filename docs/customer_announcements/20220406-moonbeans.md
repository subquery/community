SubQuery is proud to announce a partnership with Moonbeans, a community focused NFT marketplace that has taken the Moonbeam and Moonriver ecosystems by storm. Moonbeans brings together artists, creators, and crypto enthusiasts on a single platform to create and trade the top NFTs on the Moonriver (and soon-to-be Moonbeam) network.

The team at MoonBeams have built a SubQuery project which serves as a complete one-stop shop for all the data that they require to run their web application. [Their project, which can be found in the SubQuery explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/m00nbeans/marketplace-v3), aggregates events on their NFT marketplace and provides easy access to current listing data, trade history, and more.

> _"The SubQuery team has been extraordinarily quick and helpful with getting us off the ground and collaborating with us in order to provide the best experience for our users - we look forward to continuing our work with them!"_ - Smol Bean (CTO & Co-Founder of Moonbeans)

Moonbeans are well on their way to achieving their goal of becoming the native NFT platform of Moonbeam and Moonriver. Their future mission involves onboarding users from other EVMs onto 'Dotsama' (Polkadot and Kusama) by launching and cultivating communities on those chains too, a ride which SubQuery can travel alongside on, having recently announced [our expansion into Avalanche](../blogs/20220321-avalache.md) in pursuit of further multi-chain expansion.

> _"Moonbeans have been able to harness SubQuery's aggregation and indexing capabilities to elevate their NFT marketplace data performance all within one excellent project. We look forward to being a part of their imminent arrival into the Moonbeam network."_ - James Bayly, Head of Business Development at SubQuery

Moonbeans use [SubQuery Projects](https://managedservice.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. Check out this [SubQuery Snapshot](https://twitter.com/subquerynetwork/status/1497134283827339416?s=21) for an overview of Moonbeans and their project which can be found in the [SubQuery Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) --- a project library managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free.

## About SubQuery

SubQuery is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate and Avalanche projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
