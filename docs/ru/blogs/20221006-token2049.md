Last week, the entire crypto and Web3 ecosystem was in town for [TOKEN2049](https://www.asia.token2049.com/) Singapore, the industry's first major in-person event in the region ahead of the[ Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix 2022](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2022/Singapore.html) race weekend.

Apart from attending the main event, we also co-sponsored the Polkadot Lounge Party and spoke at the Algorand Developer Greenhouse Tech Talk as well!

## Polkadot Lounge Party

To kick off the highly-anticipated TOKEN2049, SubQuery joined hands with stakeholders and projects from the Polkadot ecosystem such as [Astar](http://astar.network/), [Ajuna](http://ajuna.io/), and [Moonbeam](http://moonbeam.network/), in co-organising a Polkadot Lounge Party to host the local DOT community, as well as create a familiar and communal environment to welcome the broader community into the Polkadot ecosystem.

Speakers at the event addressed a broad agenda --- from the evolving regulatory landscape and institutional investment trends to the rise of the metaverse, web3, and what all of these ultimately mean for the industry as we gear toward mainstream adoption.

Led by Polkadot and Parity, the Polkadot ecosystem banded together to form a 'Polkadot Pavilion' showcasing the exciting DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, data indexing, and cross-chain projects across the ecosystem.
