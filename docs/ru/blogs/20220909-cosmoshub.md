# SubQuery Announces Integration with Cosmos Hub

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*R3wMl60XJdapzP0V)

**SubQuery continues to expands its data indexing support within the Cosmos ecosystem**

[Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html) is the latest layer-1 to receive indexing support from SubQuery, just after the [recent announcement of Algorand support](./20220713-algorand.md). The integration with Cosmos Hub comes as a part of SubQuery's continuous effort to support multiple networks within the Cosmos ecosystem. As of today, SubQuery supports all of the following Cosmos networks: [Juno](./20220609-juno-cosmos.md), [Fetch.ai](./20220719-fetch.md), and [Stargaze](./20220726-stargaze.md).

The Cosmos Hub was the first blockchain to be launched on the Cosmos network, now consisting of thousands of interconnected blockchains, designed as an intermediary between all zones within the ecosystem. Cosmos Hub uses a standardised communication protocol and it's envisioned to become "_the Internet of blockchains benchmarking inter-chain security for network participants_."

Cosmos Hub supports scalable interoperability and the growth of its multi-chain environment, which completely aligns with SubQuery's focus on networks that are designed with a multi-chain outlook.

SubQuery is a flexible, fast, open, and decentralised data indexing solution that provides developers with the tools needed to easily organise and query on-chain data for their protocols and applications. Abstracting the backend, SubQuery provides a custom API and lets developers focus on product development and user experience rather than on building their own indexing solutions.

Cosmos Hub developers will continue to receive all the tools, [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/), developer support, and other benefits that developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem.

SubQuery also provides the [Managed Service](https://subquery.network/managedservices) for Cosmos Hub ecosystem, which provides enterprise level infrastructure hosting and handles hundreds of millions of requests each day. This is all due to SubQuery's strong origins and experience building the leading data indexer.

> Marta Adamczyk, Technology Evangelist at SubQuery, commented: *"SubQuery's mission is to accelerate the Web3 revolution by supporting ecosystems which invest in blockchain interoperability. This is why we continue to extend our multi-chain support. We are excited to deliver another integration that enables Cosmos Hub developers to index their data faster and easier, and build complex dApps with the help of SubQuery."*

Since its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving millions of queries each day to hundreds of leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala. This growth has spurred SubQuery to develop a priority list of other Layer-1 blockchains that they intend to support.

SubQuery is currently focused on decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the SubQuery Network. The SubQuery Network will be simple and accessible to all, will innovate payment methods, and most importantly, will support indexing Cosmos projects from the outset.

## About CosmosHub

[Cosmos Hub ](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html)is the first of thousands of interconnected blockchains that will eventually comprise the Cosmos Network. Cosmos Hub is designed to serve as a bridge between the autonomous blockchains generated within the Cosmos network, known as "zones." Each Zone is highly customizable, allowing developers to design their own cryptocurrency, with custom block validation settings, and other features. These Zones are created using the Cosmos SDK, which provides the basics needed for developing a Cosmos blockchain.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
