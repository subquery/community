Мы достигли многих DeFi приложений, dApp, кошельков, платформ NFT, кросс-чейн мостов и многое другое в экосистеме Polkadot. Мы планируем улучшить процесс адаптации новых партнеров с помощью примеров кода, готовых проектов и лучшей информации для разработчиков.

> Ожидая, что новые партнерские проекты наводнят нашу экосистему.

По состоянию на конец мая у нас есть в общей сложности 48 проектов SubQuery, размещенных на нашей платформе включая:

-   [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io/) (a leading Polkadot wallet that we are going to work closely with),
-   [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/) and [NFTMart](https://www.nftmart.io/) (NFT platforms)
-   [Darwinia](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/darwinia) (a cross chain bridge) and it’s test network [Crab](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/wuminzhe/crab)

Take a look at what Darwinia said about us

> _“Using SubQuery to query Darwinia’s on-chain data has become very simple and flexible. SubQuery regards blockchain data as a graph, and leverages the extensibility of GraphQL to introduce additional functionality. We believe that in the future, the data interface on the substrate chain will mainly use GraphQL, SubQuery is making this a reality”._ — [Darwinia](https://subquery.medium.com/darwinias-network-data-is-now-available-for-free-in-subquery-b4f51c73fb15)

SubQuery was selected from over 50 candidates to join the exclusive 2021 Web 3.0 Bootcamp in Shanghai. There are some amazing projects and a huge amount of talent in this bootcamp, so we’re excited to be a part of it. Polkadot is the most exciting ecosystem out there in our industry, and China is the fastest growing country building here.

We expect to learn a lot, to make a lot of new friends and partners, to get a lot of feedback on our product development. We expect to come out of this bootcamp even stronger than we are now. You can watch our opening ceremony below
