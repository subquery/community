# SubQuery Eyes Data Indexing Support for Cardano After Investment from Emurgo

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*_dPFi9QPRDTIAdCG)

SubQuery is excited to announce its intention to extend its multichain data indexing support to [Cardano](https://cardano.org/), a proof-of-stake decentralised network that was developed with the goal to allow blockchain programmers and entrepreneurs to solve scalability, interoperability, and sustainability issues of the previous blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Plans to support data indexing on Cardano were accelerated after SubQuery received investment from [EMURGO](http://www.emurgo.io/), the official commercial arm and founding entity of the Cardano blockchain. SubQuery looks forward to providing developers in the Cardano ecosystem with a leading indexing solution to allow them to build the dApps of the future.

Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies.

With a leading team of engineers, Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins - to individuals - and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.

> Takashi Hayashida, the Managing Partner of EMURGO Ventures, shared _"As an infrastructure builder, SubQuery can support EMURGO by providing fast, flexible, reliable, and decentralised APIs to various projects including DeFi, NFTs, and Wallets"_

SubQuery provides decentralised data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains including the [Cosmos](./20220909-cosmoshub.md) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) ecosystems, [Algorand](./20220713-algorand.md) and [Avalanche](./20220321-avalache.md). As an open data indexer that is flexible and fast, it helps developers build APIs in hours and quickly index chains with the assistance of dictionaries (pre-computed indices).

Engineered for multi-chain applications, SubQuery allows developers to organise, store, and query on-chain data for their protocols and applications. SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience.

> _"We are proud to work with EMURGO and support teams building on Cardano in the future with our fast, flexible and universal indexing solution. Once the integration is complete, Cardano developers will have access to the leading multi-chain indexing solution in web3 which they can leverage to build complex dApps with the help of SubQuery."_ --- Sam Zou, Founder of SubQuery

Cardano developers will benefit from the full SubQuery experience, including the open-source SDK, tools, documentation, developer support, and other benefits developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem. Additionally, Cardano will be accommodated by [SubQuery's managed service](https://managedservice.subquery.networks), which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles over 400 million requests each day.

SubQuery is currently focused on launching the Kepler canary network before decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the [SubQuery Network.](https://subquery.network/network)

Once SubQuery's Cardano support is available it will be announced on the official SubQuery social accounts. If you are interested in accessing a closed beta when ready, please reach out to sean.au@subquery.network.
