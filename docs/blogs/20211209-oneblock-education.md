SubQuery is proud to announce our partnership with OneBlock+ to promote the SubQuery Academy’s  _Hero Course_  in China. One Block+ developed the world’s first substrate developers course with engineers from Parity Asia and are recognised as leaders in blockchain education within China and around the world.

Sam Zou, the CEO and Founder of SubQuery commented,  _“OneBlock+ is well-placed to help SubQuery in its vision to empower developers around the world as they are stewards of the largest blockchain developer community in China. We look forward to engaging with the OneBlock+ team and motivated Chinese Substrate developers to build leading dApps that showcase our vision of a Web3 future”_

SubQuery’s community has always been global, and a huge number of SubQuery’s customers come from the thriving Polkadot community in China. The delivery of this course in China is the embodiment of SubQuery’s dedication to providing local language support for all of our communities around the world. Concurrently, all of SubQuery’s technical documentation is being translated by  [SubQuery Ambassadors](https://subquery.medium.com/introducing-the-subquery-ambassador-program-aa82613ab804).

SubQuery recently launched the SubQuery Academy to upskill blockchain developers globally, specifically in the area of data indexing in the Polkadot ecosystem. The  _Hero Course_  is designed to up-skill and empower developers in the SubQuery ecosystem by providing them with a modular programme. The content of this programme takes an aspiring blockchain developer from beginner to advanced over six modular lessons.

The video content is accompanied by written tutorials, slides, lab workbooks, and links to the finished GitHub code repository. The course is designed to get a developer from knowing nothing about SubQuery to becoming an expert in building a SubQuery data source for their new blockchain application. This includes developing complex SubQuery Projects and  [deploying them in SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/).

Yaxun, the Founder of OneBlock+ said  _“We are proud to be SubQuery’s official educational partner in China. Having trained over 1500 Substrate developers in China, we are excited to introduce them to the leading data indexer in the Polkadot ecosystem. SubQuery is a foundational piece of infrastructure for our students to learn and build innovative dApps with.”_

The existing “Hero Course” has been translated to Chinese and will be delivered via WeChat. OneBlock+ will provide additional learning support to students via weekly “Office Hours” on Tencents Conference platform.

The first session in the course will be scheduled from 10th January 2022, and in preparation OneBlock+ will deliver a live Technical Workshop in December 2021 as part of their regular Substrate Saturday programme. More information on the dates will be published in the  [SubQuery Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/78zg8aBSMG).
