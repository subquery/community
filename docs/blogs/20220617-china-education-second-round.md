We are pleased to announce the successful completion of our second *"Hero Course"* in China in partnership with One Block+. One Block+ developed the world's first substrate developers course with engineers from Parity Asia and are recognised as leaders in blockchain education within China and around the world.

The "Hero Course" is a free course designed by SubQuery to upskill developers on data indexing by providing them with a modular programme from the leading data indexer in Polkadot. The content of this programme takes an aspiring blockchain developer from beginner to advanced over six modular lessons. While the English version of the course is available online , the Chinese version is [conducted in partnership with blockchain educator, OneBlock+](./20220308-oneblock-education.md).

The class was conducted via video content and accompanied by written tutorials, slides, lab workbooks, and links to the finished GitHub code repository. Students also benefited from live workshops conducted directly by SubQuery's team including Siqi (Global Community Manager and China Manager) and Jay Ji (Core Developer). The course is designed to get a developer from knowing nothing about SubQuery to becoming an expert in building a SubQuery data source for their new blockchain application. This includes developing complex SubQuery Projects and [deploying them in SubQuery Projects](https://managedservice.subquery.network/).

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, and now Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
