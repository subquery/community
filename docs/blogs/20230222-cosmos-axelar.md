# SubQuery Announces Integration with Axelar Network

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*jWWUcS1YnZ9sjpzr)

SubQuery continues to expand its data indexing support within the [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) ecosystem!

[Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/) is the latest Cosmos Zone to receive indexing support from SubQuery, just after the [recent announcement of Thorchain support.](./20221221-cosmos-thorchain.md) The integration with Axelar Network comes as a part of SubQuery's continuous effort to support all zones within the Cosmos ecosystem.

Axelar Network is a scalable cross-chain communication platform. Axelar's new general message passing (GMP) allows smart contracts to communicate with each other across chains. Blockchain platform builders can use it to seamlessly plug-in their blockchains to all other blockchain ecosystems. Application developers can choose the best blockchain to host their applications and use Axelar's cross-chain communication protocols to lock, unlock, and transfer assets, as well as communicate with applications on any other chain.

> Jason Ma, Director of Business Development at Axelar, commented *"Axelar has made it clear that we plan to power the cross-chain future, and that's why we're excited to work with SubQuery, a leading cross chain indexer to bring a familiar data indexing experience to our own chain. SubQuery already works closely with many other chains that we partner with, including Avalanche, Moonbeam, and Osmosis, now dApps will find it easier to build interoperable communication and functionality on Axelar network as well."*

As of today, SubQuery supports all of the following Cosmos zones: [OKCNetwork](https://www.okx.com/okc), [THORChain](https://thorchain.org/), [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/), [Juno](https://www.junonetwork.io/), [Cronos](https://cronos.org/), [Fetch.AI](https://fetch.ai/), Axelar and [Stargaze](https://www.stargaze.zone/). We offer full support for CosmosSDK, CosmWasm, and Ethermint, further solidifying our position as a leading data indexer in the blockchain space. SubQuery provides decentralised data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains including the [Cosmos](./20220909-cosmoshub.md) ecosystem, [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Algorand](./20220713-algorand.md), [Flare](./20221202-flare.md) and [Avalanche](./20220321-avalache.md). As an open data indexer that is flexible and fast, it helps developers build APIs in hours and quickly index chains with the assistance of dictionaries (pre-computed indices).

SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience.

> _"Our team is thrilled to be providing our fast, flexible and universal indexing solution to the developers working on the Axelar Network. As a key player in the blockchain landscape, Axelar enables previously isolated chains to now interact with one another through cross-chain communication. We look forward to seeing the innovative and ground-breaking Axelar dApps that will be created with the assistance of SubQuery's indexing tools."_ - Sean Au, BD Manager at SubQuery

SubQuery's Axelar support includes an [excellent starter project](https://github.com/subquery/cosmos-subql-starter/tree/main/Axelar/axelar-starter) that indexes all depositConfirmation events on Axelar. Developers will find it easy to follow our [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos.html) to extend this starter project to index the data they need for their custom use case or the next big dApp.

Axelar Network developers will benefit from the full SubQuery experience, including the open-source SDK, tools, [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/cosmos.html), developer support, and other benefits developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem. Additionally, Axelar Network is accommodated by [SubQuery's managed service](https://managedservice.subquery.network), which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles over 400 million requests each day.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Avalanche, NEAR, Algorand, Flare and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
