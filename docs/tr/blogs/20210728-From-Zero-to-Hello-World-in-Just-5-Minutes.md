**We are working hard to help every developer learn how to use SubQuery to explore and transform their chain data so they can build intuitive dApps faster.**

Today we launch our new [documentation website at doc.subquery.network](https://doc.subquery.network/). We have carefully redesigned it with our community in mind and we’re excited to share it with you.

> _“_Documentation may not be glamorous work but it plays a vital role in communicating how something works and allows us to empower our community members to learn and unleash their creativity. That is why we believe documentation is so important_” — Sean Au (SubQuery Academy)_

[Our new documentation website](https://doc.subquery.network/) has an inviting landing page designed to welcome all users, regardless of their technical understanding of blockchain or Polkadot. From the landing page users can jump straight into a getting started tutorial, or navigate off to the help they need.

Traditionally, blockchain documentation is incredibly technical and littered with jargon — you have to come from a developer background to easily understand it. We’ve taken a different path and written content for users at all levels of experience.

Our goal is to publish a tutorial for every piece of major functionality in SubQuery. That means a step-by-step video and written guide with working examples as outcomes — you can see the beginnings of our efforts here [in the Tutorials Section](https://doc.subquery.network/tutorials_examples/howto.html).
