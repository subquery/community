# SubQuery Collaborates With Moonbeam On Data Indexing Course

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*BpBxeyjjiMzJPv2w)

We are thrilled to announce our latest collaboration with [Moonbeam ](https://moonbeam.network/)to release a new course for web3 developers, who want to learn how to build a decentralised application with the help of SubQuery. SubQuery is proud to be the first project to launch a course under Moonbeam's very own ["Moonbuilders Academy"](https://academy.moonbeam.network/p/moonbeam-subquery).

SubQuery is a fast & flexible blockchain indexing toolkit that powers hundreds of teams on Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, and Cosmos. We help developers focus on their core product, rather than waste time and money building their own indexing solution.

This educational module which is focused on the Moonbeam and SubQuery integration, is crafted specifically for the Moonbeam developer community who are looking to index EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) data.

SubQuery is proud to be the first project to launch a course in The [Moonbuilders Academy](https://academy.moonbeam.network/), Moonbeam's learning hub and educational platform for web3 developers. The Academy has been designed for developers to learn how to build multi-chain applications on Moonbeam and Moonriver.

> _"Gathering blockchain data for your DApp and transforming it to suit your needs is challenging - but Subquery simplifies and speeds up this process. The Subquery Course advances the mission of Moonbuilders Academy - to educate and empower developers to build cross-chain connected applications. Marta will take you from beginner to expert, as she breaks down complex topics into clear and actionable components. Upon finishing the course, you'll have a complete understanding of how to integrate SubQuery data into your Moonbeam DApps."_ - Kevin Neilson, Developer Relations Engineer at PureStake, the team developing Moonbeam.

## What's In the Course

In this course students will learn how to use SubQuery to index decentralised data quickly and easily so that they can focus on the most important part - building their dApps. Students can expect to learn how to index the data that they need to build a superior and performant application.

Within the course, students will create a project using SubQuery CLI and tweak it to their needs. This includes indexing Moonbeam data alongside Substate Events and exploring the benefits of such an integration, discussing data mutation, entities' relationships and other advanced ideas and upcoming features.

The course has 7 lessons, 1.5 hours of video materials, coding examples, and quizzes. After the course students will have all the know-how to develop their[ SubQuery project](https://project.subquery.network/login) further or create a brand new one tailored to their needs.

The course is presented by Marta Adamczyk, a Technology Evangelist at SubQuery, where she supports the growing SubQuery community by delivering developer-oriented content and technical education.

> _"We are thrilled to be the first project to launch a course in the Moonbuilders Academy as we believe the best way to accelerate the web3 revolution is via education. A big thanks to Kathy and Kevin and the entire PureStake team for their amazing support. I personally had a lot of fun building the course content and hope developers enjoy this resource as well!"_ --- Marta Adamczyk, Technology Evangelist at SubQuery

We are looking forward to your feedback and any questions you might have!

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
