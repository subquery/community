Kodadot is a carbon neutral Kusama native NFT platform that uses the RMRK protocol. Users can mint, transfer, and burn NFTs on the network. Most importantly, Kodadot has a responsive web based NFT explorer that provides an intuitive user interface.

This front end uses a [SubQuery project](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/vikiival/magick) to make this exploration faster.

> “At the first we had to realise how much the SubQuery is doing instead of you, so we were able to purely focus on the GraphQL architecture and NFT consolidation logic. Thanks to SubQuery, we are thinking now another feature set we can easily add over weekend” — Kodadot

[SubQuery’s](https://subquery.network/) service helps Kodadot extract and query on chain data for NFTs on Kusama, and do this in a more energy efficient and carbon friendly way.

In the example below, we’re using SubQuery to find the first 5 NFT results that match the search term “Canary” on Kusama.

Kodadot is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services we provide are completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery’s Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).
