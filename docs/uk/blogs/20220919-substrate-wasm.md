# SubQuery Now Provides Support for Substrate Wasm

With today's announcement of Substrate Wasm support, SubQuery reaffirms its position as Polkadot's premiere indexing provider. As well as now supporting Cosmos, Avalanche, and Algorand, SubQuery also provides deep indexing support for Polkadot with Substrate, EVM, and Wasm.

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), or simply Wasm, is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed to compile high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, used in Polkadot and Substrate. Wasm is used to write smart contracts that operate in a similar, but more efficient and performant manner to the Ethereum Virtual machine (EVM). Wasm is widely pioneered by the [Astar](https://astar.network/), [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/), and [Gear](https://www.gear-tech.io/) networks from within Polkadot.

Wasm is quite universal and can run instructions across whatever machine it is operating on. This makes it a perfect solution for blockchains, because it helps to establish reliable state transition updates across all the nodes. It is efficient, fast, and it ensures reliability among a diverse set of machines.

> "SubQuery recognizes the great potential and benefits of Wasm. We have listened to our customers' feedback and invested in Substrate Wasm support to allow even more flexibility to SubQuery users and to provide complete support for all smart contract languages in the Polkadot ecosystem." --- James Bayly, COO of SubQuery

SubQuery provided a special data source processor dedicated to Substrate Wasm. This offers a simple way to filter and index both WASM, EVM, and Substrate activity on many Polkadot networks within a single SubQuery project. This allows developers to get data from different, incompatible sources and use it all in a unified form in the same project.

Wasm is a developer-friendly, time-saving solution and is easy to get started with! With a few simple steps, developers can index data from Substrate and Wasm. We've intentionally designed it to work as seamlessly as possible with the existing Substrate and EVM support, and it uses similar Call and Event handling logic as our EVM data processor.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Algorand, Terra, and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
