The [Web Summit](https://websummit.com/) is a hugely popular technology conference held in Lisbon, Portugal that welcomed 70,000 attendees this year!

The conference's topics center on internet technology, emerging tech, and venture capitalism. Web Summit's partners range from Fortune 500 companies to start-ups, with attendees representing all levels and sectors of the global high technology industry.

The Web Summit has been successfully held since 2009, but this year it was booming with Web3 presence! [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) & other leading chains and protocols took up large sections of the Web Summit.

We saw many of our Web3 frens there and we were happy to find out that the three day schedule was full with blockchain and crypto related topics. If the only topic that interested you was Web3, there was something to listen to from early morning until late afternoon.

Some of the most interesting talks we attended were:

- "How blockchain can create an inclusive society" by Marieke Flament (CEO of Near Foundation)
- "Will Web3 make or break social media" by Sandeep Nailwal (Co-founder of Polygon)
- "Is crypto dead" by Charles Hoskinson (the founder of Cardano)
- "Will DeFi save the global economy" by Mitchell Amador (CEO of Immunefi)

We noticed a similarly strong Web3 presence at the [Singapore FinTech Festival (](https://www.fintechfestival.sg/)SFF) this year, with many boots being taken up by Web3 companies like [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) and [Okcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/). We can definitely say that we are seeing a growing presence of the crypto industry in the world's traditional technological and financial systems.

The SubQuery team also never stops building and moving towards an open-source data indexing solution that supports all chains. Our Marketing Manager [Martina Beg](https://twitter.com/MartinaBeg) was representing us at the Web Summit this year and was sharing the word about our fast, universal & flexible indexing solution.

Since its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving hundreds of millions of queries each day to leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala. The success in Polkadot spurred SubQuery to integrate with other Layer-1 blockchains to become a truly universal solution.
