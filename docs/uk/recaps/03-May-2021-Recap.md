За лаштунками ми були як ніколи зайняті в травні, розширюючи нашу команду, поставляючи продукцію, а найголовніше - залучаємо якомога більше партнерів.

У цьому щомісячному оновленні:

- Більше партнерів SubQuery приєднуються
- Ми наймаємо!
- SubQuery є частиною табору Web3.0

Останнім часом ми звертаємось до багатьох протоколів, додатків DeFi, dApps, гаманців, платформ NFT, мостів з перехресними ланцюгами та іншого в екосистемі Polkadot. Ми плануємо вдосконалити наш процес адаптації для нових партнерів, щоб пришвидшити це, додавши приклад коду, готові проекти та покращивши інформацію для розробників.

**Expect the stream of new partner projects to turn into a flood.**

At the end of May we now have a total of 48 SubQuery projects hosted on SubQuery including:

- [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io/) (гаманець Polkadot, з яким ми будемо тісно співпрацювати),
- [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/) i [NFTMart](https://www.nftmart.io/) (NFT платформи)
- [Darwinia](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/darwinia-network/darwinia) (міст з поперечним ланцюгом) і тестова мережа [Crab](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/wuminzhe/crab)

Take a look at what Darwinia said about us

> _“Using SubQuery to query Darwinia’s on-chain data has become very simple and flexible. SubQuery regards blockchain data as a graph, and leverages the extensibility of GraphQL to introduce additional functionality. We believe that in the future, the data interface on the substrate chain will mainly use GraphQL, SubQuery is making this a reality”_ — [Darwinia](../customer_announcements/20210528-Darwinias-Network-Data-is-Now-Available-for-Free-on-SubQuery.md)

SubQuery was selected from over 50 candidates to join the exclusive 2021 Web 3.0 Bootcamp in Shanghai. There are some amazing projects and a huge amount of talent in this bootcamp, so we’re excited to be a part of it. Polkadot is the most exciting ecosystem out there in our industry, and China is the fastest growing country building here.

We expect to learn a lot, to make a lot of new friends and partners, to get a lot of feedback on our product development. We expect to come out of this bootcamp even stronger than we are now. You can watch our opening ceremony below

Next month we’ve got some exciting new announcements to share with our community, stay subscribed to our social media channels to hear about them first.
