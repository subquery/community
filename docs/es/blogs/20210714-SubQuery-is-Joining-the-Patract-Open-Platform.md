## **Providing Free Data Indexing for Wasm Tech Alliance**

SubQuery is joining the Patract Open Platform to jointly promote the development of public infrastructure, promote the evolution of contract technology, and to develop the Wasm contract development ecosystem.

SubQuery is a blockchain data-as-a-service provider.

SubQuery aggregates and organises data from Polkadot and Substrate, providing developers with well-structured data support that allows them to use data in various projects efficiently.

By doing so, SubQuery helps DApp developers focus on the core and front-end development without the time-consuming task of building a custom back-end for data processing, saving development time and effort.

SubQuery can help Polkadot and Substrate projects build better DApps by supporting every Substrate and Polkadot ecological team to process, query, transform, and store data.

Today, anyone can query and extract data from Polkadot in a matter of minutes with SubQuery’s free help.

SubQuery believes that contracts are an important part of a thriving Polkadot ecosystem. Providing data indexing services for Wasm contracts has always been a major goal of SubQuery. SubQuery is excited to see that the Open Platform has brought together a large number of great projects, and that everyone is working together to contribute to the healthy and stable advancement of Wasm contracts.

SubQuery will be working with contract projects within the alliance to participate in early trials of our supported contract versions. Providing free data indexing technical support and deployment services. All projects can use SubQuery’s open source SDK to build their own SubQuery Projects, which can then be uploaded and hosted by SubQuery where they run the project and provide GraphQL query services. Secondly, the SubQuery Network will be online soon, and SubQuery will provide all participants with a decentralized and transparent network, to better solve the data inefficiency problem.

Patract Labs believes that the development of Polkadot Wasm contract technology requires continuous supplementation and improvement of infrastructure. SubQuery joins the Patract Open Platform as a data infrastructure provider that complements the need of Polkadot’s ecosystem, providing decentralized data, by liberalizing access, and reducing the operating costs of connecting and applying data in a project. Therefore, developers no longer need to invest a lot of time to build and maintain their own indexing solutions. Secondly, it is difficult for blockchain data to be directly stored in DApps, since DApps need to obtain and transform data from the underlying data source. Thus, the on-chain indexing scheme of SubQuery is a great foundation for explosive growth of DApps in the Polkadot ecology. Currently, SubQuery is also exploring a solution combining SQL tools with Wasm smart contracts, and we are looking forward to it.
