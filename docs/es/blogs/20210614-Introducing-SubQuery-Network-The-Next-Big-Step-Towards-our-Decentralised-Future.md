# Introducing SubQuery Network — The Next Big Step Towards our Decentralised Future

**SubQuery’s mission is to make decentralised data more accessible.**

We transform and organise data from Polkadot and Substrate projects, and then provide that data for developers to use for a wide array of projects (wallets, explorers, custom chains, or any other dApp).

Everyone knows that a core weakness of blockchain data is that the processing and query performance is extremely inefficient. SubQuery provides an open source SDK, which provides the instructions on how any Indexer should traverse the blockchain, what data to collect, and how it should be shown to users.

Creating a SubQuery project is, and always will be, free. Developers should spend time building, not running infrastructure. However we believe that a healthy decentralised future requires multiple distributed data service providers working together to improve resiliency, speed, and network performance.

# Introducing The SubQuery Network:

The SubQuery Network is our effort to move towards a decentralised and tokenised network in order to ensure no single point of failure for SubQuery and to encourage as many participants in the process as possible.

[We’re releasing our white paper today for the world to read](https://static.subquery.network/whitepaper.pdf).

The SubQuery Network’s guiding principles are simplicity and flexibility. We’re trying to make it easy for participants to get involved in the network, but also give developers control to adapt SubQuery to fit their needs for any Substrate based chain.

**The SubQuery Network aims to power the vibrant ecosystem of decentralised applications in the Polkadot and Substrate ecosystem, we hope you join us for the ride.**
