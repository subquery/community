SubQuery arrived in Austin at Consensus 2022, an annual gathering of the world's brightest and most innovative blockchain minds.

Despite a chilling macroeconomic climate, Consensus 22 was on fire, both in terms of the temperature and the activity at the largest crypto festival in the world. Sam (CEO) and James (Head of Business Development) were there from SubQuery with a mission to share about SubQuery's fast, flexible, open and universal indexing solutions for blockchain developers to focus better on their front end and use-cases.

It was great to catch up with old friends from our favourite projects including Acala, Astar, Crust, Moonbeam, Phala to name a few; SubQuery's Grant recipients and last but not least, our enthusiastic ambassadors and community members! It was the first time we managed to meet some of our oldest customers, including ones that we have worked with for almost 2 years!

Is Crypto Winter here? Not that it matters at Consensus 2022, as the crypto community marches on with high-conviction, and web3 builders continue to build. At SubQuery, we are mostly insulated from any macro effects in the market. As an essential infrastructure provider, our customers keep building with SubQuery regardless, and our partnership pipeline is only expanding!

There's nothing like talking to old friends over a cocktail or two, and to facilitate this we worked with OAK to co-host the Hotsama Rooftop event. Over an amazing night on one of the best rooftop bars alongside Lady Bird Lake we shared stories with customers, investors, and even grant recipients.

It was also exciting to forge deeper connections within the space, particularly with the OAK team. James was invited to present on OAK's podcast about the impacts of Polkadot's XCM work with Irsal and Chris from OAK, and Stephen from Tinkerbox. We were happy to learn that the OAK team found our products most helpful building their automation solution for DeFi and recurring payments. Positive feedback definitely goes a long way in motivating us to improve our product offerings as we know that we are building something that is useful for the community. You can expect the OAK podcast to be released soon!

## Giới thiệu về SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
