We are pleased to announce the successful completion of our second *"Hero Course"* in China in partnership with One Block+. One Block+ developed the world's first substrate developers course with engineers from Parity Asia and are recognised as leaders in blockchain education within China and around the world.

The "Hero Course" is a free course designed by SubQuery to upskill developers on data indexing by providing them with a modular programme from the leading data indexer in Polkadot. The content of this programme takes an aspiring blockchain developer from beginner to advanced over six modular lessons. While the English version of the course is available online , the Chinese version is [conducted in partnership with blockchain educator, OneBlock+](./20220308-oneblock-education.md).

The class was conducted via video content and accompanied by written tutorials, slides, lab workbooks, and links to the finished GitHub code repository. Students also benefited from live workshops conducted directly by SubQuery's team including Siqi (Global Community Manager and China Manager) and Jay Ji (Core Developer). The course is designed to get a developer from knowing nothing about SubQuery to becoming an expert in building a SubQuery data source for their new blockchain application. This includes developing complex SubQuery Projects and [deploying them in SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/).

## Về SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) là bộ công cụ phát triển blockchain cho phép các nhà phát triển xây dựng các ứng dụng Web3 cho tương lai. Một dự án SubQuery là một API hoàn chỉnh để tổ chức và truy vấn dữ liệu từ các chuỗi layer 1. Hiện đang phục vụ các dự án Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche và bây giờ là Cosmos, dữ liệu dưới dạng dịch vụ này cho phép các nhà phát triển tập trung vào phát triển cốt lõi sản phẩm và giao diện người dùng của họ mà không cần lãng phí thời gian vào việc xây dựng chương trình phụ trợ để xử lý dữ liệu. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
