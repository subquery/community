SubQuery is delighted to announce a partnership with [Blockathon DAO](https://blockathon.xyz/) to support their blockchain education initiatives and upcoming Metaverse Hackathon. The hackathon is intended to prepare teams to participate in the [Global Metaverse Startup Competition at the Metaverse Summit](https://www.metaverse-summit.org/) in Paris this July.

In order to expedite the development of the teams in the hackathon, SubQuery will be providing free workshops to the teams on data indexing and providing bounties. In addition, sister company OnFinality will be providing discounts for node related services.

[James Bayly](https://twitter.com/jamesabayly), Head of Business Development at SubQuery commented, *"SubQuery has always believed in the power of community-centred learning experiences. Accelerators, grants, and hackathons are outstanding catalysts of web3 development and we are beyond excited to partner with Blockchain DAO. SubQuery is already being used by teams across every niche you can imagine and we are excited to see how the teams will leverage SubQuery in the Metaverse Hackathon"*.

Daniel Bar, Core Contributor of Blockathon DAO added, "The *Blockathon is exhilarated to partner with A class infrastructure project SubQuery and empower our teams with their leading edge data indexing solution. The blockchain learning curve is steep and we are thankful to work with partners like SubQuery to help further understanding of Web3 technologies via our Learn2Earn program run as Public Good"*.

In addition to running a workshop for the teams, all developers will receive all the tools, [documentation](https://doc.subquery.network/), developer support, free managed hosting, and other benefits that developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem, including being eligible to apply for [SubQuery's Grants ](https://subquery.network/grants)upon completion of the programme.

SubQuery's data indexing technology provides developers with the tools needed to easily organise, store, and query on-chain data for their protocol and applications. Tóm tắt phần backend, SubQuery loại bỏ nhu cầu về các máy chủ xử lý dữ liệu và cho phép các nhà phát triển tập trung vào phát triển sản phẩm và trải nghiệm người dùng hơn là xây dựng các giải pháp lập chỉ mục của riêng họ.

Blockathon was originally started in 2017 by the Bitfwd team as a series of Blockchain Hackathons and entrepreneurial education programs and events. In 2022 Blockathon was taken into the digital realm in order to scale the educational experiences and make them available to people from all walks of life and all regions of the world. Web3 users and enthusiasts around the globe are now welcome to join the online sections of the program with a chance to meaningfully contribute to cutting-edge Web3 projects early on.

Since its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving hundreds of millions of queries each day to leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala. Now the SubQuery team is focused on decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the SubQuery Network which will be launched in the second quarter of 2022.
