When building a dApp for thousands of users, it is essential that you are able to measure and learn from your user's behaviour. As such, it is imperative to us that our customers have superior tools to analyse and learn more about their SubQuery projects. [Off the back of our recent UI redesign](./20220901-managed-service-redesign.md), we are able to add even more value to the SubQuery Managed service by adding Project Insights.

The release of the Project Insights page has been highly anticipated by our customers and has elevated the Managed Service to be more than just infrastructure hosting, it's now a complete service. Within one platform, you can reliably publish your latest creation, scale your app to thousands (if not millions) of users, and now view detailed analytics and insights on how your SubQuery Project is operating.

> _"We pride ourselves on opening the eyes of others to just how powerful data can be, it only makes sense that we elevate our own UI with the limitless data we have access to. Now our customers can dig deeper into the performance of their SubQuery projects and rest easy relying on our premium hosting solution."_ ᠆ Brittany Seales, Customer Success Manager at SubQuery

With the new Insights page customers can see how their projects have been performing with in depth detail on request count and data egress over any time period. This is just the beginning, and we're interested to hear what you think we should add next to our Project Insights.

We've also updated our project list UI with a fresh design which makes the project overview much more informative. The overview now shows the health status, shows indexing progress of both production and staging deployments, and it also has a search bar for quick access to a specific SubQuery Project. This addition was particularly exciting for our wallet customers such as [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/), [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io/) and [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/) who have projects for every single parachain and would previously have to scroll through rows and rows of projects to find the one they're interested in.

The final addition to our Managed Service was our new usage centre page which serves our customers with an overview of their total deployment hours across all projects as well as a breakdown of these hours within each project. Customers can see how many hours their projects were deployed in the staging versus the production slot and they can use these insights to drive efficiencies in the future.

These new features show why some of the biggest dApps across Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche, and Algorand depend on SubQuery's enterprise level managed service, with 100s of millions of daily requests and hundreds of active projects, SubQuery's managed service provides industry leading hosting for our customers. Our customers use [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to publish their latest creations, upgrade existing projects, and view detailed analytics on how their SubQuery Project is operating.

You can take advantage of SubQuery's [enterprise-level Managed Service](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20211228-enterprise-hosted.html) to see all these UI updates plus options for dedicated databases, automated deployments, and geographic routing to multiple clusters around the world for performance and uptime. Head to [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to get started or reach out to sales@subquery.network if you'd like a demo first.

## Giới thiệu về SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
