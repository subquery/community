# Fetch-ai Releases New SubQuery Indexer Documentation

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*1Of1JoEIo3gXuDoK)

SubQuery is delighted to announce that [Fetch-ai Network](https://fetch-ai.network/) has released new SubQuery indexer documentation for all devs building on Fetch-ai. The initial SubQuery indexer docs are live here: [Fetch-ai Documentation](https://docs.fetch.ai/ledger-subquery/introduction).

In short, the purpose of this documentation is to serve as a guide on how to get started with the SubQuery indexer on the Fetch-ai Network. If you want to get started right away, you can head over to the [sandbox UI](https://subquery.fetch.ai/) and more detailed documentation is available here: [Fetch-ai Github.](https://github.com/fetchai/ledger-subquery)

Fetch-ai is an interchain protocol, based on the Cosmos-SDK. Fetch-ai is building an open access, tokenized, decentralised machine learning network to enable smart infrastructure built around a decentralised digital economy.

SubQuery's flexible, fast, open, and decentralised data indexing solution provides developers with the tools needed to easily organise and query on-chain data for their protocol and applications. Abstracting the backend, SubQuery provides a custom API and lets developers focus on product development and user experience rather than building their own indexing solutions.

Since its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving hundreds of millions of queries each day to leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala.

The success in Polkadot spurred SubQuery to integrate with other Layer-1 blockchains starting with Avalanche, [Cosmos](./20220609-juno-cosmos.md), and Algorand to become a truly universal solution, with [Fetch-ai Network being one of the most recent integrations.](./20220719-fetch.md)

## About Fetch-ai Network

[Fetch-ai Network](https://fetch-ai.network/) is delivering AI to the crypto economy. Autonomous Economic Agents, powered by artificial intelligence, provide automation to decentralised finance that can serve the needs of a single user or aggregate millions of data points for on-chain oracles. These agent-based systems provide greater flexibility, speed and crypto-economic security than existing layer-1 solutions and represent the future of decentralised finance. The Fetch-ai network is an interchain protocol, based on the Cosmos-SDK, and uses a high-performance WASM-based smart contract language (CosmWasm). This also allows the Fetch-ai network to serve as a layer-1 network for Ethereum and as an interchain bridge to the rest of the blockchain world.

## Giới thiệu về SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Algorand, and Cosmos projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.
