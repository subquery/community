![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*E059TXajzXqkqW2g)

SubQuery [launched an Ambassador programme](./20210713-Introducing-the-SubQuery-Ambassador-Program.md) in August 2021 to find community leaders who were passionate about the potential of SubQuery. Our goal was to find self-starters that could spread the word about SubQuery in their local areas and provide support to new developers who were building innovative dApps and services within our ecosystem.

Within a short span of time, we were overwhelmed by the number and quality of applications from all over the world!

After consultation with our initial Ambassadors we created an additional [Spartan Programme](./20211101-spartan-programme.md) as an avenue for passionate individuals to have a chance to become an Ambassador. The Spartan Programme exists entirely within our Discord community, where aspiring Ambassadors can complete monthly tasks and competitions in order to earn the Spartan tag. The Spartans who then rise to the top of their class will be recommended by the existing Ambassadors to the SubQuery team to join their ranks.

Since the launch of the Ambassador programme, we have also identified several individuals who have also attained a higher level and we would like to formally thank and introduce them today! Please feel free to connect with them via their social media handles and to find out more about our Spartan and Ambassador programme please [join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/subquery).

Dmytro speaks English, Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian and Polish and has over 7 years of experience in marketing and business development. His experience is evident in his initiative in organising events, holding online meetings with influencers and his suggestions for the community.

Most importantly, Dmytro values people and enjoys sharing knowledge, providing opportunities, and uniting people with a common goal.

> _I am a fan and early explorer of the Polkadot ecosystem. I believe that it is they who will build the very great Web3 almanac of the future. But for the full functioning of the ecosystem, we need to open up a world of accessible and fast data and that's how I met SubQuery on June 14th, 2021. If Polkadot is the body, then SubQuery is memory and heart. For building more complex and intuitive applications, developers need more powerful tools for data processing and queries. SubQuery offers developers to focus more on the development of applications and solutions for them. SubQuery's believes that developers of applications will change the future while SubQuery will be engaged in maintenance of the exponentially growing infrastructure."_ - Dmytro

Nick has a degree in linguistics specialising in Germanic philology and literature, but also has a passion for marketing and management.

He was interested in crypto since his school days, but it was not until university that he decided to take it seriously and take the necessary steps to familiarise himself with the crypto world. He believed that people would soon change their attitude towards cryptocurrencies and start to look into it more deeply, and that this topic would become very popular and commonplace.

Nick speaks four languages, English, German, Russian and Ukrainian and has over two years of success in community management, team collaboration, leadership and strategic planning. His focus is on the Blockchain space, specifically DeFi technology and smart contract platforms, which he believes will change the world.

> _"I started my journey in SubQuery about one year ago. I liked the story of the project as well as the team, the goals and of course the technology. My research also revealed that SubQuery offers a great professional development programme for community members, which to me indicates a commitment to collective improvement that I value. The team members were very responsive and always willing to help newbies with questions. That's why I immediately decided to join the Ambassador programme. It was the right decision, and now I am very happy to be a part of and stand at the origins of such a wonderful project."_ - Nick

Prathak is a doctor who is interested in a variety of fields, but his greatest interest lies in investment and technology.

He learned about the world of blockchain while studying programming on his own during his university years in his free time. He was drawn to the possibilities and potential of new technologies and became deeply passionate about blockchain, especially DeFi and DAOs. Other favoured topics for him are artificial intelligence, ZKP and how blockchain can be used in a more privacy-focused environment.

In addition to his interest in blockchain and new technologies stemming from his software development background, he also has literary and poetic abilities.

In his spare time, he reads novels, comic books, and exercises regularly. On long weekends, he often goes out on a motorcycle to explore the nature and lifestyle of the local people. He aspires to have a positive influence on others such as his family and friends.

As a SubQuery Ambassador, he desires to use this opportunity to create an open-source instructional resource regarding blockchain applications. He envisions the resource to involve not just instructions on dapp creation for novices, but also scientific research on subjects such as AI and ZKP.

> _"Aside from the fact that the SubQuery team and community are amazing. The reason I like SubQuery is because I see the great potential that SubQuery will bring to the blockchain world. Being able to access and analyze data on blockchain is very important in taking blockchain to the next level. Especially now that data is more valuable than gold."_ - Prathak

## Giới thiệu về SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot , Substrate and Avalanche projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
