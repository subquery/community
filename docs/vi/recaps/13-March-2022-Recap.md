Welcome to the latest SubQuery Monthly Update!

As usual the past month was action-packed with the news of our integration with Avalanche taking centre-stage. We also made massive progress towards our TGE after announcing the launch of our Testnet, "The Frontier" and have invited the first participants to our closed beta.

Meanwhile, we also announced partnerships with several teams in Polkadot and we rewarded our rapidly community by continuing our partnership with Gitcoin.

## Community

### SubQuery Provides Web3 Developers More Opportunities via Gitcoin Hackathon

After running our first Gitcoin Hackathon in December 2021 and achieving fantastic results with many talented developers it was an easy decision to extend our partnership.

> _"SubQuery is proud to partner with the Gitcoin GR13 Hackathon to build the future of Web3. It is in our interest to support motivated developers around the world to build on top of our data indexing service which is why we also recently launched a $500,000 SubQuery Grants Programme. We have developed bounties that should excite graduates of our 'Hero Course' and developers who are new to SubQuery and look forward to seeing the results"_ - Sam Zou, Founder and CEO of SubQuery

### SubQuery supports Automata Network to deliver Web3 privacy services

SubQuery is excited to announce our partnership with Automata, a decentralised service protocol that provides middleware-like traceless privacy services for dApps on Ethereum and Polkadot. SubQuery is working with Automata to allow developers access to a high performance indexing solution that will power Automata's rapidly growing application ecosystem.

> _"Subquery has become the standard indexing protocol within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, and it is not without reason. The team has been prompt, exceptional, and we're pleased to continue working closely with them as Automata focuses on its middleware solutions to bring forth a fair-minded and privacy-focused Web3."_ - Deli Gong, Automata Network

### SubQuery provides an open data foundation for Astar, Polkadot's dApp Hub

We're excited to share the close partnership between Astar and SubQuery to provide key data infrastructure to applications within Astar's application ecosystem. Our two teams share the same vision, to encourage development of the next generation of dApps in Polkadot and catalyse our transition to web3.

### SubQuery Launches "The Frontier" Testnet

We are pleased to announce the launch of our testnet, "The Frontier". In SubQuery's case, the launch of the testnet marks a critical milestone in our development as we progress towards the full deployment of mainnet which coincides with our token listing on centralised exchanges.

In order to run the testnet effectively, we require it to be battle-tested by experienced node operators who are experts in running high performance and scalable productions with monitoring and wallet/infrastructure security. Since our [call for indexers to participate](../blogs/20211202-indexer-invitation.md) we have been overwhelmed by the interest from our community and have recently approved an initial group of indexers who will soon receive their invitations to participate in SubQuery Frontier's seasons 1 & 2.

> _"SubQuery is excited about the launch of the SubQuery Frontier Testnet and what it represents to both ourselves and our loyal community. The choice of "Frontier" as our testnet name also denotes where we believe we are in the growth of Web3 and that we want Indexers to push beyond the limits."_ - Ian He, CTO of SubQuery
