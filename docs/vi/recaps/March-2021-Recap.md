# Tóm tắt Tháng 3 năm 2021

It’s been an intense last couple of months at OnFinality and SubQuery, we’ve expanded the team and have brought on some new partners as we launch some key new projects. In this monthly update:

-   SubQuery Explorer
-   Cập nhật vòng hạt giống
-   Trường hợp đối tác đầu tiên sử dụng SubQuery
-   Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator
-   Định tuyến thông minh
-   Văn phòng mới và các thành viên trong nhóm

## SubQuery Explorer hoạt động

[SubQuery Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) is an online hosted service that provides access to published SubQuery projects made by contributors in our community around the world and hosted by the SubQuery team. You can test queries directly in your browser, or get API endpoints for different use cases. Be inspired by what others are building so you can give back!

Chúng tôi chạy các dự án SubQuery trong đó giống như chúng là các ứng dụng sản xuất, vì vậy, bạn có thể mở khóa dữ liệu phi tập trung của mình trong dApp tiếp theo ngay hôm nay bằng cách sử dụng SubQuery.

## **SubQuery Tăng 1,8 triệu đô la vòng hạt giống để mở rộng trong tương lai**

SubQuery is ready to grow and deliver! [We successfully raised a US$1.8 million seed round](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-raises-1-8m-seed-round-for-future-expansion-3348c1f2a931) and private sale backed primarily by DeFi Alliance, D1 Ventures, Hypersphere Ventures, Digital Finance Group (DFG), and The Lao. The overwhelming demand we received to back SubQuery’s seed round shows the strong interest in infrastructure services and belief in the future of the Polkadot ecosystem.

_We’re planning a subsequent private sale/raise later this year. If you’re interested in taking part please register here:_ [_https://forms.gle/6LMapDNSidQAqy347_](https://forms.gle/6LMapDNSidQAqy347)

## **SubQuery Explorer hoan nghênh trường hợp sử dụng đầu tiên của đối tác**

SubQuery is all about providing data services to our partners and customers. Every blockchain team and dApp builder has a need to process and query data quickly, and for the web3 dream to be realised, it’s got to be as fast (if not faster) than centralised networks for the end user. That’s why we’re ramping up our efforts to partner with the top Polkadot projects to provide free SubQuery services for their protocols.

[Earlier we launched our first partnership with our close friends at Acala](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-integrates-acala-to-aggregate-and-serve-defi-data-to-polkadot-and-kusama-builders-fc9af6a7aae1) to allow users and developers to query and extract data from Acala’s DeFi hub for Polkadot in only minutes and at no cost. When you access the SubQuery Explorer you’ll be welcomed with a new Acala SubQuery Project. This SubQuery dynamically tracks all the extrinsic data created on Acala and can quickly show derived aggregated stats for the following:

-   Dữ liệu lịch sử về những thay đổi thanh khoản (được chia nhỏ bởi các nhà cung cấp)
-   Dữ liệu lịch sử về tất cả các hoán đổi tài sản chuỗi chéo
-   Lịch sử gao dịch

> You could create a dApp for lenders showing collateralization ratio, loan amount, interests accrued, etc. Or a service for decentralised exchanges with pair liquidity, pair exchange rate, trading volumes.

Chúng tôi đang có kế hoạch sớm cải thiện các công cụ đối tác của mình và đang lên kế hoạch giới thiệu các giao thức hàng đầu khác trong một hoặc hai tuần tới với tốc độ nhanh chóng.

_Do you want to get started and create a new SubQuery project for your own dApp —_ [_get started now_](https://doc.subquery.network/quickstart.html)_. We’ll even host it in our_ [_SubQuery Explorer_](https://subquery.medium.com/announcing-the-subquery-explorer-48c051483730) _for free!_

## **Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator**

[We were excited to announce in March](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-joins-berkeleys-blockchain-xcelerator-7ea81f96af73) that Berkeley has selected SubQuery to be part of their exclusive [Blockchain Xcelerator](https://www.xcelerator.berkeley.edu/). SubQuery (and it’s parent company OnFinality) were selected from over 200 applications to be part of just 21 exclusive spots.

Berkeley’s blockchain Xcelerator is known around the world as one of the most successful blockchain accelerators for a reason. It has incubated over 40 companies that have raised over $25M in seed and early stage funding, and over 75% of the inaugural batch raised follow-on funding.

## **Định tuyến thông minh**

We’ve recently been [awarded a treasury grant](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/72) to complete an intelligent routing layer that allows us to expose multiple clusters behind a single endpoint. This will allow us to scale our service better, and quickly fall over to redundant clusters in the unlikely event that some of our infrastructure goes down. Both OnFinality and SubQuery rely on this infrastructure so it’s important that we continue to invest and improve here.

## **Nhân viên và Văn phòng mới**

One of the biggest changes over the past month is how much the team has grown. We’ve added two new staff over the past month and expect to hire more, as a result, we’ve found a new office in Auckland that fits us perfectly. We will grow, but still plan to remain small and nimble so we can deliver our product vision.
