![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*qzKzZnWY2ao3tiffwwugXQ.png) **_This month it’s all about execution_**

Welcome to the latest monthly update from SubQuery, and one that is particularly full of all the exciting stuff happening around our community.

## SubQuery Network

### SubQuery to launch on Acala

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/0*SJ1TWt1sGwUWqvuI.gif) At our community call, we finally announced that SubQuery and the SQT token will aim to be the first external application and token to launch with Acala.

We considered a variety of options before electing to deepen its existing partnership with Acala by launching on its leading DeFi protocol built on Polkadot. The three main reasons that went into this decision to launch with Acala were community access, domain/technical excellence, and our existing robust relationship.

James caught up with Acala’s Bette Chen for a wide-ranging interview on this decision and partnership, including the specifics on why Acala and SubQuery are a match made in heaven.

### Significant Development on the SubQuery Network

Even though we are busy working hard on the SubQuery Network, and still rushing ahead towards our test network launch in the first quarter of 2022. We’ve made great progress on our smart contracts and refining our token economic model. Expect to see us sharing a lot more about this soon.

## Core Product Development

### Scaling our Hosted Service

SubQuery Projects has been a recipient of some explosive growth over the past month as [thousands of academy participants](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20211018-subquery-launches-the-subquery-academy.html) have created even more projects in our hosted service ([project.subquery.network](https://project.subquery.network/)) in the space of a few weeks.

We’ve crossed a milestone of over 2,000 projects deployed to our hosted service, and as a result, it’s been a priority to scale our hosted service. We now offer our enterprise customers dedicated resources to improve performance and reliability.

If you would like to upgrade your SubQuery project to receive dedicated resourcing, contact us at [sales@subquery.network](mailto:sales@subquery.network).

### Supporting External Chain Type Files in our Project Manifest

In November we launched [**version 0.2.0**](https://doc.subquery.network/create/manifest/) of our project manifest file (`project.yaml`). This new version provides developers with various improvements that have been requested by customers.

Most importantly, you can now reference a chain type definition file that has all the custom types included when you’re indexing a custom substrate chain. This quickly allows you to connect a new SubQuery project to any substrate-based chain, including all of Kusama’s parachains.

[You can read more about this new feature here](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20211105-november-technical-update.html#support-for-external-chain-type-files-in-project-manifest).

### Moonriver EVM Support

As previously announced we have implemented support for the Moonbeam and Moonriver networks in SubQuery. In November we followed up with all the developer resources that you need to get started. [You can read the instructions here](https://blog.subquery.network/blogs/20211105-november-technical-update.html#moonbeam-evm-support).

Additionally, Scott was able to present this entire workflow to the [Moonbuilders workshop](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/moonbuilders-ws/10) for everyone to watch. Perfect timing for the lead up to the Gitcoin Grants that we are sponsoring (more on that below).

## Community

### Analysis into the Polkadot Crowdloans

SubQuery is Polkadot’s leading data indexing service, and over the past week, we’ve been powering millions of daily requests to the majority of the crowdloan dashboards, contribution apps, and analytics websites. Teams like [**SubVis**](https://www.subvis.io/), [**Parallel Finance**](https://parallel.fi/), and [**DotMarketCap**](https://dotmarketcap.com/) rely on SubQuery to provide real-time data on the crowdloans and other on-chain data directly to their websites and apps.
