Tuần trước, [DotMarketCap.com](https://dotmarketcap.com/) đã ra mắt ngay trước đợt đấu giá Kusama Parachain thứ hai để cung cấp dữ liệu, blog, giá cả và các nội dung khác trên hệ sinh thái Polkadot/Kusama.

A huge amount of this live, real time data comes from SubQuery, specifically from the existing project maintained by [SubVis](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/subvis-io/kusama-auction). This is an excellent example of how [SubQuery's Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/) and open source approach facilitates collaboration and teamwork in the Polkadot ecosystem

> *"SubQuery, with over 60 projects and millions of query requests per day, as well as data from Subvis, is the perfect place to support and provide DotMarketCap with the fastest and most accurate access to Crowdloan & Auction data. With that reliable data source and DMC's signature UI UX, we believe this partnership will bring great experience and easy access to the Polkadot community."* - Sang Tran (Founder DotMarketCap)

Đấu giá Kusama parachain là sự kiện quan trọng nhất trong năm nay và với tính năng [Đấu giá & Theo dõi Crowdloan](https://dotmarketcap.com/auction), bạn có thể nắm được sự cạnh tranh khốc liệt giữa các dự án, cũng như hỗ trợ các ứng viên yêu thích của bạn giành được vị trí parachain thông qua crowdloan của họ.

For SubQuery, this is a realisation of our goal to build an open community marketplace of data in our Explorer. This is the best example so far of a huge customer consuming data from a SubQuery project built and maintained by another team. It shows how symbiotic the Polkadot ecosystem is, and how teams work together to achieved a shared goal of a decentralised future

> *"For sure DotMarketCap 2.0 couldn’t be completed without the support of our partners: SubQuery and [Subvis.io](http://subvis.io/). All the data we used for our auction & crowdloan page was taken from [Subvis.io](http://subvis.io/). Thanks to this cooperation, things are much easier for us to get access to decentralised data. We would like to express our gratitude to Sam Zou, James Bayly and the entire SubQuery team."* - DotMarketCap
