Parallel's mission is to innovate and bring DeFi to the next level and to a broader audience. Today we are excited to reveal how Parallel Finance are using SubQuery data in [their new application](https://testnet.parallel.fi/#/overview).

> *"SubQuery is an excellent tool which brought traditional indexing & query technology to Parallel Heiko. The plug-and-play service really saved us a lot time developing our own block indexing tool and maintaining our own solution."* - Parallel Finance*

[SubQuery's](https://subquery.network/) service helps Parallel Finance store, analyse, and query data on their current Heiko testnet. Some of this data is used directly in Parallel's new application, helping users understand and analyse DeFi data.

> *"We enjoy working with the SubQuery team and the one-to-one customer service they give us. We plan to use it more as we introduce more features into our DeFi application."* - Parallel Finance*

Trong ví dụ bên dưới, chúng tôi đang sử dụng SubQuery để hiển thị tỷ giá hối đoái lịch sử cho tất cả các tài sản ở tất cả các khối dữ liệu.

Parallel Finance is using [SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network/) to manage their own project and make updates as required. The indexing and query services we provide are completely managed by SubQuery and provided to the Polkadot community for free in [SubQuery's Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/).

## Giới thiệu về Parallel Finance

Parallel Finance is a decentralized money market protocol that offers lending, staking, and borrowing in the Polkadot ecosystem. Similar to the relationship between Polkadot and its "canary network" Kusama, Heiko Finance is the sister network to Parallel, and the parachain that we hope to launch on the Kusama blockchain. We are building for a decentralized future that empowers the community to increase capital efficiency, security, and accessibility through our leverage staking and auction lending platform.

## Giới thiệu về SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a data aggregation layer that will operate between the layer-1 blockchains (Kusama) and DApps (like Kodadot). This service allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing.
