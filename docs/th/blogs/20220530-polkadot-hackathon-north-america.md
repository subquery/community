**_SubQuery supports developers in the Polkadot ecosystem via a four way bounty between SubQuery, Moonbeam, Acala and HydraDX._**

Today we are excited to announce our participation in the [Polkadot Hackathon: North America Edition](https://go.polkadotglobalseries.com/Subquery-Network), running from May 30th until July 11th 2022. Polkadot invites developers to learn, build, and experiment in hackathon which has a total prize pool of over US$550,000.

As part of the Polkadot Hackathon, SubQuery has [several bounties](https://go.polkadotglobalseries.com/Subquery-Network) worth US$11,000 in addition to co-sponsoring the [largest single challenge bounty worth $20,000 in a four way partnership between Subquery, Moonbeam, Acala, and HydraDX](https://github.com/subquery/grants/issues/26). This four way challenge is focused on building an XCM (cross consensus message format) user interface. XCM is a foundational new technology of Polkadot that allows parachains to interoperate and seamlessly transfer value. The challenge aims to provide an elegant user interface for end users of XCM transfers so they can clearly track assets and locations of assets transferred via XCM.

SubQuery's mission of making the world's decentralised data more accessible relies on having a network of developers who are empowered to create and innovate. As the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot, the decision to collaborate with such an exciting event was clear after achieving fantastic results with talented developers in previous hackathons and other educational events.

In addition to bounties, SubQuery will be running a workshop and all developers will receive all the tools, [documentation](https://doc.subquery.network/), developer support, free managed hosting, and other benefits that developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem, including being eligible to apply for [SubQuery's Grants](https://subquery.network/grants) upon completion of the programme.

[Sam Zou](https://twitter.com/zoujialiu), the CEO and Founder of SubQuery commented, _"SubQuery is proud to partner with the North American Edition of the Polkadot Hackathon to build the future of Web3. It is in our interest to support motivated developers around the world to build on top of our data indexing service which is why we also recently launched a_ [_$500,000 SubQuery Grants Programme_](https://subquery.network/grants)_. We have developed bounties that should excite graduates of our 'Hero Course' and developers who are new to SubQuery and look forward to seeing the results."_

Since its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving hundreds of millions of queries each day to leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala. Now the SubQuery team is focused on decentralising and tokenizing the protocol to build the SubQuery Network which will be launched in mid-2022.

For developers who are eager to [learn how to build applications in SubQuery we encourage them to join our free "Hero Course" in the SubQuery Academy](https://subquery.coassemble.com/unlock/dOKZW6O#/) and then register to take part in the [Polkadot Hackathon today](https://go.polkadotglobalseries.com/Subquery-Network).

## เกี่ยวกับ SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a blockchain developer toolkit enabling others to build Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot , Substrate, Avalanche and Terra projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The SubQuery Network proposes to enable this same scalable and reliable solution, but in a completely decentralised way.
