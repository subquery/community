The amount of information about the crypto space is huge, but you shouldn't be discouraged. It's not about how much is out there, but about how fast you can learn!

So just dive into it as soon as possible. Especially within the Polkadot community it is easy to enter because they're very helpful. You can ask the Polkadot team everything, they're very approachable, says Anton.

A great way to start is to simply get involved (e.g. start helping in Discords). You don't have to start big, the crypto space is very friendly!

Also, a lot of Web2 skills are needed in Web3 (e.g. marketing, growth, biz dev, etc.) and a lot of the current Web2 skills are transferable to Web3.

## Wanna work in the Web3 space?

The crypto space is developing fast and there's a high need for all kinds of talent, from developers to marketing and pretty much everything in between.

Don't be afraid if you don't have Web3 experience. A lot of the people who start working for Web3 projects don't have it either!

What is important is that you're a fast learner. It's a young space and it's moving fast. Few people really know "everything" about crypto anyways, so what is important is that you are adaptable, willing to learn and that you can think outside of the box.

You can join a DAO and contribute there to get noticed, or reach out to the founding team and propose how you can help the project! The easiest way though is to apply for an open position, like the ones we have at SubQuery: [SubQuery jobs.](https://subquery.breezy.hr/)
