วันนี้เรามีความยินดีเป็นอย่างยิ่งที่จะประกาศเปิดตัว testnet ของเรา "The Frontier" testnet ย่อมาจาก เครือข่ายทดสอบ (test network) ซึ่งหมายถึงเครือข่ายที่นักพัฒนาใช้เพื่อทดสอบโค้ดก่อนที่จะนำไปใช้กับเครือข่ายหลัก (หรือ Mainnet) In SubQuery's case, the launch of the testnet marks a critical milestone in our development as we progress towards the full deployment of mainnet which coincides with our token listing on centralised exchanges.

In order to run the testnet effectively, we require it to be battle-tested by experienced node operators who are experts in running high performance and scalable productions with monitoring and wallet/infrastructure security. Since our [call for indexers to participate](./20211202-indexer-invitation.md) we have been overwhelmed by the interest from our community and have recently approved an initial group of indexers who will soon receive their invitations to participate in SubQuery Frontier's seasons 1 & 2.

Indexers in the SubQuery Network mark the transition of SubQuery to becoming a decentralised service as they will host and organise the blockchain data on their infrastructure. We expect that this will massively increase SubQuery's uptime, provide better redundancy, and increase performance by driving down latency.

Ian He, CTO of SubQuery, commented, _"SubQuery is excited about the launch of the SubQuery Frontier Testnet and what it represents to both ourselves and our loyal community. The choice of "Frontier" as our testnet name also denotes where we believe we are in the growth of Web3 and that we want Indexers to push beyond the limits."_

The Frontier Testnet will be rolled out in stages that we call "seasons, starting from April 11th. Each season will go for 2--3 weeks.

- Season 1. Early stage alpha testing of a limited number of features with less than 30 participants.
- Season 2. Large beta testing of more features with more participants.
- Season 3. Full public test network for load and scale testing --- open to all interested parties.

The testnet is for development purposes and will undergo significant development enhancements during the seasons. More details are available on the SubQuery documentation website: https://university.subquery.network/
