SubQuery, the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot, would like to extend an invitation to all potential indexers to register their interest in participating in our move towards decentralisation in 2022 via our incentivised testnet.

[You can register your interest here](https://forms.gle/RyXyhb8T9Gxkwi7R9)

As indicated in the  [recent publication of our Technical Roadmap](https://subquery.medium.com/subquery-releases-technical-roadmap-2a3a383c49b), SubQuery is currently preparing for our token generation event (TGE) in March 2022. Our current focus is the migration towards a decentralized SubQuery Network, and a key component of that is the need for indexing providers to form a foundational layer of our future network infrastructure.

> _“Indexers play a critical part in the SubQuery Network and we are looking to find the best node operators and technical community members to take part in our upcoming testnet. If you wanting to partner with us in building, improving, and scaling the future of decentralised data, please apply now. Our invitation to collaborate with the Indexer community is an exciting step for us as it is represents another major step towards our decentralisation”_ —Sam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery

We’re looking for node operators with a deep understanding of the SubQuery Network, including the revenue streams and how staking and delegation works. You’ll need to be an expert in running high performance and scalable production applications with monitoring and wallet/infrastructure security. Finally, you’ll need a great attitude and a shared belief in growing the future of web3.

Indexers who are interested in participating  [can register their interest with SubQuery here](https://forms.gle/RyXyhb8T9Gxkwi7R9). After reviewing all of the applications, we expect to approve an initial pool of Indexers by the end of January 2022 with the testnet launching at the end of Q1 2022. Indexers will be retrospectively rewarded and invited to participate in the subsequent mainnet anticipated at the end of Q2 2022.

## The SubQuery Network

The key constituents of the future SubQuery Network are  [outlined in our Whitepaper](https://static.subquery.network/whitepaper.pdf)  and consist of Consumers, Delegators and Indexers. Of these, the Indexers are integral to the backbone of the project as they will host SubQuery Projects in their own infrastructure, running both the node and query service to index data and answer GraphQL requests. Consumers are those entities who make requests to the SubQuery Network for specific data (thereby ‘consuming data’) and pay an advertised amount of the SQT token. The final actor in the ecosystem are Delegators who participate by supporting their favourite Indexers to earn rewards.

## About SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/)  is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications. This service unlocks blockchain data and transforms it to a queryable state so that it can be used in intuitive applications. It allows DApp developers to focus on their core use case and front-end, without needing to waste time on building a custom backend for data processing. The upcoming SubQuery Network will decentralize and tokenize the ecosystem to allow everyone to participate in the web3 data revolution.
