SubQuery Joins Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF) 2022, the world's most impactful financial technology Festival!

Since its inception in 2016, [Singapore FinTech Festival (](https://www.fintechfestival.sg/)SFF) has become the premier platform for the global FinTech community to engage, connect, and collaborate on issues relating to the confluence of financial services, public policy, and technology.

SFF has been successfully held for 7 years, but this year it was booming with Web3 presence: 20% of the participants were from the crypto industry!

We noticed a similar strong Web3 presence at the Web Summit 2022 in Lisbon this year, with many boots being taken up by the likes of [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) & other leading chains and protocols. We are slowly but steadily seeing a growing presence of the crypto industry in the world's traditional technological and financial systems.

[Siqi](https://twitter.com/SIQI_JIA7), our Global Community Manager, attended SFF. She met with our old friends[ crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) and [Okcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/). We also met a lot of new friends and shared the word about SubQuery's fast, flexible, open and universal indexing solution with them.

Regardless of the crypto winter, at SFF we witnessed the passion of people actively building regardless if it's bull or bear. SFF had 60,000 participants, the Web Summit had 70,000 and [TOKEN2049](https://www.token2049.com/) Singapore had nearly 10,000 people!

The SubQuery team also never stops building and moving towards an open-source data indexing solution that supports all chains. Since its founding in 2021, SubQuery established itself as the leading data indexing solution in Polkadot and has achieved rapid growth by serving hundreds of millions of queries each day to leading projects such as Moonbeam and Acala. The success in Polkadot spurred SubQuery to integrate with other Layer-1 blockchains to become a truly universal solution.
