SubQuery Projects

Today we’re launching the next phase of SubQuery — [Projects](https://project.subquery.network). SubQuery’s mission is to make the world’s decentralised data more accessible, so this announcement this week is huge for our community!

[SubQuery Projects](https://project.subquery.network) is the new place where you can publish your projects to our managed service. Once you connect your GitHub account, you’re only minutes away from sharing your SubQuery project to over 500 users of the [SubQuery Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/). Your own project can be hosted online right next to our existing SubQuery projects from [Acala](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/OnFinality-io/acala-subql) and [Bifrost](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/bifrost-finance/subql).

You can also keep your SubQuery project private by not showing it in the Explorer, perfect if you want to privately test it using our managed infrastructure. Additionally, we’re integrated with GitHub, so creating a SubQuery project within a GitHub organisation account will automatically share it with your team members.

Creating a new SubQuery Project

Once you’ve published and deployed your new project, you can interact with it over our GraphQL endpoint or simply play in our [Explorer playground](https://explorer.subquery.network/)! We’ll run it like it’s a production application, so you can unlock your decentralized data in your next dApp today using SubQuery.

A new published SubQuery Project

Don’t worry about running production SubQuery nodes, leave it to the experts. We’re going to focus on managing indexing servers so that you don’t have to.
